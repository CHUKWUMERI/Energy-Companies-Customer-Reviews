Since opening an account after my husband died I have been unable to open an on line account. Made at least 3 calls/chats and raised a complaint but still no joy. How hard can it be to  see my bills on line? Terrible service. I feel like switching for this alone.

British Gas, if you going to launch a new app why do you come with a product which is so awful ... Interface is bad and plain, now when looking energy usage is not possible to compare different months or years, which was possible in previous app, you are still showing I have an account associated to an address i have moved out almost 3y ago .... Honestly

Received a letter saying we were ¬£1800 in credit then received one saying we owe ¬£1800. Their customer service line is a Kafkaesque maze. Got passed through 5 people, having to tell the same story 5 times, only the phone 1.5 hours just trying to talk to someone that could tell me if we owed money or are owed money. Absolute joke of a company. Customer service so bad I‚Äôd not use the company again

I received a letter on 17 November saying my a/c no. was changing but did not mention any other changes or wld be sending me a bill for 2 months when my contract with them is to receive qtrly bills.  Also did not mention they would need meter readings.  The bill was an estimated bill, and way overestimated.  Have checked online and a B.Gas article says they have been planning this change of accounting system since 2021 and not to worry there would be no changes.  But they have changed things and are in breach of contract.  I do not have to accept an estimated bill.  When I complained, this arrogant person in the executive dept phoned me and said he was closing my complaint and twice refused to send me a deadlock letter so I could take my case to the ombudsman.  They do not comply with their own complaints procedure either. Why is this awful company with such arrogant staff still allowed to operate as a business.

I submitted my meter readings for this month 25/11(as i do every month) The next day i got an email reminder which i ignored. But 2 days after that i got a text reminder. I duly checked my a/c and my readings had been stored. I used their we chat 242 in line but seemed to be progressing quickly so i hung on. When i finally got someone she asked ""would i like her 2 submit my readings"", of course i replied yes. Then when i asked about the chasing msgs she replied with some totally wacky reply then told me to ignore it. When pressed for an answer to my question she told me i could submit my readings 2morrow!!! I gave up but on checking my a/c 2nite the latest statement is for the period 30/9/22 (!) - 29/11/23!!!!!! USELESS is a kind way of putting it. I won't  be as kind when i ring them 2morrow.

Very poor customer service following a recent move to an EV Driver contract. Complicated by fact my old account was on the ‚Äòold system‚Äô.

 Shameful Lie!

I can't recommend companies that employ liars. 

The smart meter installers did not turn up for installation in the morning timeframe provided. They did not call and did not ring the doorbell. I've received a text saying:

""We visited your property today to fit your smart meters, but unfortunately, nobody was at home - we're sorry we missed you.""

This is a freaking lie and completely unacceptable! 

I was sitting at home, waiting for the engineer to come.

I called British Gas immediately after receiving the text, and they could not organise installation on the same day. I've taken an unpaid day off partly to get this done. What a waste.

That's it. They have just lost a customer.

Hi..  I've been without heating and hot water for 5 days with 8 children in house and one is a cancer patient... I had waited patiently for a engineer to attend today.. I got a text at 8am saying engineer will attend at 8:34  so I got up and ready at 8:30 I went to toilet for 1 minute and came back to front door and the engineer posted a card saying sorry visited at 8:30am you were not in... I waited for hours and days... couldn't the engineer wait a few minutes. But I was at my door for 8:31 ... it was still few minutes b4 he arrives left... and I got onto phone straight away and every time I tryed to chat to someone on option 2 it just kept cutting me off... then I went on text chat and they couldn't do anything either... its been  a hour and still not got through to anyone... really disappointed and will recommend to all family and friends and customers at my spar shop to re think about getting British gas cover ... I'm not worried abt myself it my 8 children in the house!!!

In March this year we called out B G as we had a problem with our heating and hot water and this was covered under our service contract.  First engineer came and confirmed we had a problem but couldn't fix it but arranged for an appoint with a colleague who could. 
Second engineer came and found the problem and said we had a blocked water pipe and would have to drain the system to fix it. Tried to drain but said the tap on the drainage system was stuck and could not be opened.  Told him there were other drainage points which strangely enough were also stuck. He saw we had a wood burning stove and said he was not ""HETAS"" certified so was not allowed to work on the system and had to cancel the service contract and but a do not use sticker on the boiler and left.
Here we were in March with frost in the North Pennines, 80 next year former Cancer sufferer and wife with no heating or hot water. 
Our local plumber was able to drain the system and checked all drainage points and all worked perfectly.  Problem fixed at a cost of ¬£300.00 which should have been fixed under a contract we paid for. 
Since then we have been contacted by BG a number of times and a previous review in September was responded to  by Kam who was sorry to hear and said if I contacted them on Facebook or Twitter or pop then a DM with Trustpilot they will do their best to help. I am 80 and have no idea what the duce they are talking about? Are they going to  refund my ¬£300. Do they seriously think we have gone all this time with no heating or  hot water. 
Since September they have contacted us again pestering us to rejoin their service scheme.  That is fine if they think I can just throw money at them and when I have a problem cancel the cover due to our having a woodburner.
Please leave us alone.

Absolutely rubbish app and customer service yet they made almost ¬£970 million profit in the first 6 months of the year - a rise of 900% on the same period in the previous year. I am so appalled by then that I‚Äôm desperate to leave but can it find out my end of contract date or whether there will be an exit fee because that‚Äôs not been updated on the new app. I went on their chat today and was 494th in the queue - for chat! I don‚Äôt want online chat. I‚Äôm a human being and I‚Äôd like to speak to a human being. I was given a phone number to call which isn‚Äôt on their app yet. When I called it they said that they were so busy there would be a long wait and they were prioritising those without gas supply or their vulnerable customers so anyone else please ring off. I would suggest to them that they use some of their obscene amount if profit to employ more staff and set up some more telephone lines.

Hi ,
I called several times on the customer services num,ber as 03332029386 in regards with installation of new meter on site, gave MPN no etc and address as she was unable to understand and take the inquiry or find any resolution while she was from overseas.
I requested that if she can pass to another colleague based in UK who can better handle my inquiry as its now my 4th Call to you guys and I am not reached to the points where matter could be resolved.
She responded as you are discriminating saying want to talk to someone in UK.I said this is not the case but as I keep repeating information and you are not taking it serious,there is lots of unacceptable noise in your background and on the top understanding is not great.
All i want service not arguments but she continued with her version.

I cannot count how many occasions I have contacted them, hours of my life for appalling service. No follow up or actions taken. Extremely unhelpful. I waited at home all day for an appointment but the engineer never showed up, I was not notified of a cancellation and waiting until 6pm when I should have been in the office at work. I also waited at home for a phone call booked weeks in advance because that was their only available time to call me and I would need to provide meter readings. They never called me. This was after them refusing to send anybody out to check our incorrect meters for 3 months of me asking. The readings were saying ¬£800 for our energy bills in one month (when we were on holiday), they still refused to send an engineer and insisted it was correct. The woman was rude on the phone (one of the million times that I called). They then threatened me with debt collectors after one British Gas consultant advised me to cancel my direct debit. When they eventually came out to look at the smart meter they agreed it was faulty so changed it. Then the monitor they installed at the time did not work and wasnt showing readings for gas. They did not install a carbon monoxide alarm as was promised (I believe this is a legal requirement and I asked specifically for the man to do it).  I have asked for an email to confirm my complaint but did not receive one (on three occasions). Absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced, cannot stress enough how terrible both their customer service and processes are.

Diabolical customer service, who fail to listen and fully understand your complaint. Make wrongful assumptions and hide behind policy for policies sake.

Appalled by how a long serving customer has been left with damage to my property that they claim to have repaired when they haven‚Äôt, have failed to listen to the fact that they haven‚Äôt completed the necessary repairs to the property. Have left us with a leaking toilet and holes in ceiling and bathroom while my partner is recovering from cancer.

Avoid this company at all costs, they fail to complete repairs, because they are Ill equipped with poorly trained staff, who keep telling me they can‚Äôt complete a repair, but when pushed they suddenly can.

I‚Äôve been paying for a service that is not fit for purpose as they cannot make good on faults when it comes to plumbing, and keep telling me all the reasons why they can‚Äôt do such and such, displaying poor and negative attitudes, refusing to escalate when requested and constantly stone walling in the hope you will just go away, 4 months in still no resolve, and I am not going to go away quietly.

If you have this service in place, cancel it now, there are way better companies out there, who believe in assisting their customers when they are in need, rather than looking for every excuse not to fulfil the contract you have with them.

I concur with every bad review on here about poor customer service. Over 30 yrs as a customer of BG Home Care which has gone completely downhill. Very difficult to speak to a human being, I abhor the automated phone lines, and will not use a chat bot service.  Multiple  engineers out to fix a growing list of problems with central heating and hot water. Two more faults caused by the engineers themselves. No one has an oversight of the problems, happy to pass it on to the next engineer that has to come out.
Very dissatisfied customer here.

I've been a B. Gas. homecare customer  for a long time paying by monthly direct debit last year I had water running out the outside overflow pipe and had to wait for two weeks without hot water when the engineer arrived he said this is an easy fix? and I don't think he was at the house more than ten minutes that's how easy it was too fix?
This year end of October beginning of November same thing happened water running out the outside overflow pipe but this time it ended up being a botched fix? 5 visits for a very simple fix doe's this not tell you some engineers need to be retrained?...1st engineer pumped up an expansion vessel then left water was still running out overflow?...2nd engineer fitted a new valve which didn't work ? the same engineer left two drips under the boiler?... 3rd engineer he fixed the water that was running out the overflow pipe so that was now fixed?...4th engineer he came and looked at the underside of the boiler to see where the dripping water was coming from and said I needed two new parts and he would be back on the Thursday he didn't turn up and didn't even have the decency to phone me?...5th visit engineer comes with one part he then goes and looks at the other part under the boiler to see if he could order it
he then said that part is obsolete and it's a waste off time fitting the part he had so I asked him if he could tighten the nut in question which he tried to do but I still had two drips caused by a B.Gas. engineer I'm sure this engineer could have done more to help me but he didn't? So at the moment the boiler is working fine I've managed to fix one drip myself and have got a little pinch more on the other nut the water coming out is bearable? I think if the last engineer loosened the nut and put some ptf tape around it I believe that would have worked going by how much water is coming from it now? I'm over 74 years old and this is how B.Gas. look after the elderly.

They tried to overcharge me by ¬£720 this month!!! 
I'm a careful user of energy, and my bill is always under ¬£30.
The customer ""helpline"" (poorly named as help is far from what they actually provide), resulted in a rude woman shouting that ""they don't make mistakes"" that I should just ""pay it"". I tried to explain that it was obviously an error, and I wasn't going to pay for energy I haven't used, but she kept talking over me and refused to listen to anything I had to say. I'd honestly give this joke of a company zero stars if I could.

I have a credit balance with British Gas and requested a ¬£1000 refund from an online chat representative on 25 October. I was assured, exact quote: ""I have issued the refund for you amount ¬£1000; you will receive the amount within 5-7 working days in your bank account :)""

I didn't receive it. On 10 November, 12 working days after it was promised, I got another representative. This time I was assured, exact quote: ""as its not received to you I've asked the advisor to kindly get back to you with its status to you as an urgent priority refund query....Sure, you'll receive the email from the advisor in next couple of hours""

I didn't receive the email and contacted chat representatives again several hours later. This time, exact quote: ""As the amount was high this was pending formrefund team for sometime. But i am happy to see that it has been authorized and soonyou will be credited with it'""

I asked for a confirmation email, and received this on 10 October, exact quote: 'This is to confirm that the refund has been issued by the payment team for ¬£1000 on your account which whould be refunded to your bank on or before 14/11/2023 as per the processing time.""

The refund didn't arrive (of course!) so I contacted BG again on 15 November to ask where it was. This is the response, exact quote: ""Tthere is no refund issue from our side I'm really sorry for that.""

And why was there no refund? Exact quote: ""i see your refund is showing cancelled because your bill has not been generated last 28days"". Well -- the reason 28 days have elapsed since the last bill is that BG has failed to pay the refund from 25 October when the request was within the billing period, to 15 November when it wasn't-- all BG's fault!!!

And what willl BG do about it? Exact quote: ""To process the refund the direct debit collection date should not be more than 3 working days and your next direct debit date is on 16.11.23 that is the reason we are unable to process the refund"".

So after all that, I am right back where I started -- worse off, actually, because I have to wait 3 working days from 16 November to even BEGIN the refund ordeal again.

During all this time I have not received even one message from BG telling me my refund is delayed or cancelled.
I've been with BG for over 40 years but I notice that their rival Octopus has MUCH better customer reviews.

Awful, awful, awful. British Gas moved to a new billing platform which disconnected my original account and the new one that they then gave me. Then because I was not occuppying the house, their payments system couldn't cope with the low meter readings I was giving them. The operator at the South African call centre made up a higher reading to get this into the system then I was given a really high bill. I had a hell of a job getting my money back, with complete incompetence at the call centre. I couldn't even get through to a manager. Later when I had sold the property, British Gas continued billing me despite giving a clear final reading and paying the resulting bill, I've no idea how they made up the figures and no one could explain. A nightmare, you have been warned!

New contract with BG Homecare. Waited a few weeks for a boiler service. Last appointment of the day and at 17.02 was told he was on his way by their technology.

Evidently, as it was the last call of the day, the engineer went home and was a no-show. Apparently, it was my fault as I didn't answer my phone. If only it had rung! If only he'd found me on google maps and come knocking on my door. 

I've now cancelled my BG Homecare policy.

Tomorrow I will move my energy supplier to a company who actually gives a damn.

If there was a no star option  i  would use it. Absolute pathetic excuse for a company money grabbing good for nothing robbers. Customer service is diabolicle. Line is terrible when  calling  there call centre in Africa i had one agent that yawned ü•±  twice when i was trying  to get mg problem  sorted out they sent me a bill for over a grand  on the 21/2/23 they said it was because i had not done my meter  readings from 2021 to 202s . It took me 7 months to pay this debt off . They sent me a payment card to pay at the post office and agreed a payment plan which i did my meter reading  on the 6th of the month then  i would pay the 10th of the month . Then they started  sending me letters saying i was behind wih my payments then they cancelled my payment card because i was behind with my payments and ended up.withba bigger  bill as apparently  its more  expensive to pay with  a payment  card which i had no idea . I eventually  paid the debt off on the 11/8/23  and fed up payment plans so i just paid the 281.81 pounds i had left to pay so i thought as it went down to 0 as i was elated then  then i did my meter reading on  6 /10/23 and they cancelled my payment card and said  i owe 446.73 what a curveball. I rang them up and got a yawning agent in africa . I regret paying the whole lot off in full which left me quite poor that month then  i moved to octopus  energy on 4/10 /23  then  bg charged me 98.59 and on the 8/11/23 my debit card was declined and they had taken out ¬£687.75 then returned it as not enough  funds . I was livid and rang   them and they  cut me off  after much anger they asked me to do a meter reading  on the 9/ 11/23 and bill went down to  4.87 .  I paid it off but still have 1000 of credit which they deny . Worst company  ever moving to octopus hopefully plain sailing from now on

Moved in to a property on 22/08/23. It was supplied by British Gas. I called up to register the account under my name, get the meters zeroed and get gas and electric cards so I could top up. I also needed the gas meter to be on my name and zeroed or in credit before the housing association would uncap the gas meter. I had the engineer booked for the 25/08/23 to uncap the meter.
I waited for 5 hours in a queue to be spoken to. The first call got dropped within 3 minutes to my horror. I call back up and wait a further 1.5 hours at which point a get someone that actually got things going.
The electric meter zeroed instantly. The gas meter I was told that it would be done in 3 hours.
They also told me that I could get the gas card from the shop and I could top up the electric online. I went to the shop to get the card I waited 4 hours, I then follow the directions given to me to pair the card and then wonder off to the shop and put ¬£20 on the card. I come home stick the card in to be greeted by an outstanding balance of +¬£40 of debt from the previous tenant! I now had to wait until the next day as the call centre was shut and I definitely didn't want to wait in a queue again.
I couldn't get the meter zeroed in time for the gas engineer 2 visit over next 5 days. In this time I switched to Octopus Energy as I knew that I could trust them. I knew my switch date was 4/09/23 so I booked the Gas engineer to uncap my gas meter for 6/09/23. I contacted British Gas to tell them I was switching they advised me to top up as the funds would be transferred to my new supplier so I stupidly top up another ¬£20 on gas and ¬£20 on electricity. So when I switched over Octopus Energy, they highlighted that British Gas had told them that I had used gas and they knew from the previous calls that I had with them that it was capped as I had already explained about the capped meter issue and gas safety certificate. When I saw my final bill I knew that British Gas was robbing me. I got the electric bill and it only showed 1 ¬£20 top up. I rang up they refunded straight away.
I then got the gas bill. I had topped up ¬£40 in total they were telling me that I had used gas.
I left British Gas on 4/9/23!!!!
My gas meter was upcapped by my housing association engineer on the 6/09/23, who took photos for insurance purposes.
So there could have been no usage.
They refunded ¬£20 straight away and argued about the rest of it. Every time I call in they try and tell me that they know I have not used gas but the standing charge for 13 days is ¬£20!!!!
PLEASE LOOK ELSEWHERE THESE GUYS ARE OUT TO ROB YOU!
They hold on to your money when they owe it to you, gaining interest on it.
But if you owe them money they charge you interest.
They take advantage of simple people like myself confusing them on the telephone to suit their agenda.
Just remember British Gas puts the SHARE HOLDERS 1ST, MANAGERS 2ND, FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN MADE UP JOBS 3RD, THIRD PARTIES THAT SUPPLY PARTS, MATERIALS, SERVICES AND OTHER STUFF 4TH, customers 5th and their staff 6th.
20 years ago you could trust British Gas but now I wouldn't even recommend them to my worst enemy!
Still waiting for my refund.... 9/11/23.

AVOID. Would give zero stars if possible. Customer service is dreadful, you go around in circles in chat - the advisors don't understand what you are saying, they are obviously running off a script that doesn't work. The promise you they can do things, but do not deliver. Have spoken to 4 agents in 2 weeks and they have not sorted anything. Can't get through to anyone on the phone.

Avoid unless you want your boiler broken after a service and 4 subsequent visits to leave you with no hot water or central heating in winter. This  happened to us with british gas in 
2016 2018 and 20w3. If you're brave enough to complain before the frost bite sets in then be prepared to wait their suggested 8 weeks whilst they read your catalogue of complaints. Incompetent scam artists who once they have broken your boiler will be good enough to quote for a  new one which will be at least ¬£600  more than any other company. Avoid at all costs.

Three years on since we moved into a new house; I have one case with the Ombudsman and another about to be lodged; British Gas seem to just ignore any escalation request by the Ombudsman; it leaves any consumer helpless.

Avoid, avoid, avoid; I don't think they have a single employee that knows what they are doing (or perhaps they are still sitting at home watching Netflix three years after the pandemic????)

We had problems with our programmer, so I phoned British Gas. They sent Justin, who I thought was superb. Justin, not only fixed the programmer, he also programmed our Heating and Hot water to come on, at fixed times that I mentioned. Not only that, he cleverly explained the functions of each button on the programmer. He also asked if we had a carbon monoxide detector, and when we said 'no', he gave us one for which we'll pay when we get the invoice. British Gas, you're lucky to have someone like Justin working for you. Thanks a million, Justin. Ram Srinivasan

British Gas caused a gas leak by attempting to remove the incorrect meter at my property, when we realised what he was doing he bodged the gas pipe back on, we smelt gas days later and cadent come out, they had reused an old corroded washer! 
They continue to get our bills incorrect charging for a meter not in use

Dont usually complain but as a younger person trying to get a leaking boiler fixed without a great deal of success I can only imagine how difficult elderly people find this - now sat on the phone with at least a 20 minute wait - no-one every complain about the NHS when we have private companies providing such inadequate service, especially when I pay nearly ¬£200 a month for gas and electric and I have insurance cover on the boiler - also the next available appointment on the app is 5 days away we could have a swimming pool rather than a kitchen by then!

I've been a BG customer for over 30 years. This new App BG has switched customers is truly appalling. Before it was so simple to keep an eye on your daily spending, make top up payments etc. Now that's all been taken away for a bland, non informative App. I couldn't even get into the App in the first place without jumping through hoops. My pin number has been removed so now back to remembering long password. I'll give BG a month to rectify then I will be moving my Gas and Electricity to another provider who can supply the information I require. Extremely disappointed that a company of this size could get it so wrong. I'm sure a lot of customers will be thinking as I am.

Absolutely worse energy company.!! Useless. They treating people in unprofessional manner. They suppose to fit pre-payment pay as you go meter into my property, but instead engineer lied it's a temporary meter. Free gas etc until electricity will be taken over.. nothing never happened. It was actually a smart meter, direct supply. And the tried to issue me with hefty bills. This company is a scammer, no care for single parents who are struggling. And having kids. They will try you by giving you wrong service and meter
.. 9 months later and I still don't have a pre-payment pay as u go meter. They really don't care. Do not use their service. Bad negative phone call experiences . Just transferring you from one department to another. Nothing will be done. Useless. You could never imagine how much stress these people put me through.

British Gas has made what should be a routine billing procedure into a number-crunching hell hamstrung by a labyrinth of inconsistent bills and unresolved technical difficulties.

We switched to a direct deposit some months ago to keep from getting wildly varied bills every three months. Everything was going smoothly until two of our flatmates decided to move out, so I asked for a refund on our credit to pay them back for energy they wouldn't end up using. The reps confirmed we could do that until our Electricity Meter inexplicably stopped sending data and said we used more electricity in six weeks in the middle of summer than we did throughout the entire winter! During that period our flat was nearly empty, and we have not high-power appliances running. Not only did we get with a MASSIVE bill, but they said they can't do anything about it until the meter is fixed. That was two months ago and we are still waiting for them to send an engineer despite our issue being made ""priorty."" This word has lost all of its meaning.

Avoid this company at all costs. They are more than happy to allow customer problems go unresolved so long as it makes them more money.

British Gas should have the word ""British"" striped from their trading name, because Companies House state that any company which uses the word ""British"" in its name must prove they are ""pre-eminent in their field....."" 

Eminent is defined as having: ""high status and importance owing to marked superiority"" (over its competitors)..... 

The rubbish which comes out of BG employees' mouths, along with the false promises, and the ridiculous suggestion to remedy issues via facebook and instagram tells you all you need to know about British Gas and its obvious demise, it is simply a  company unable to cope with even the most basic client transaction!

In June of this year I applied for a EV Tariff, which was accepted, and the change scheduled. A date in August was also scheduled for the necessary smart meter installation. 

The date arrived, but the fitter did not show at the allotted time. When I called British Gas I was told that ""the fitter is probably just delayed - so please hold tight"", 

However no one arrived! 

The following day I called British Gas to be told I was no longer eligible for a smart meter and I had been put back on a variable tariff.......???!!! 

After a heated conversation, I  was able to make another request for an EV tariff, which was accepted, and a date for installing the smart meter was scheduled for Monday 13th November between 08:00/12:00. 

However, 2 days later I received a letter from British Gas, ""Thanking me for my change from a Variable Tariff, to a Variable Tariff.......!!?"" 

Two and a half hours were spent on the phone with British Gas, with many consultants who seemed to know nothing about the products being sold, nor apparently how to use the phone system they  use (as I was cut off at least 6 times, and on one occasion, was passed back to my own number, as I found myself listening to my own answer phone!) 

I was then told I could be put onto a list of customers who are ""interested in having a smart meter and an EV tariff, and someone would call me, probably next year""...... 

When I objected to this suggestion, I was given numerous reasons why my request was problematic, some included: 

Smart Meters are made in Russia and the UK government's embargo forbids us purchasing them, 

Too many people want Smart Meters, and

There isn't enough electricity to supply cars at night. 

When I just tried to point that because I had scheduled everything in June, but British Gas had cancelled the arrangements (twice), it was unfair that I now found myself at the end of the queue. Incredibly, the British Gas employee sniggered out loud, and when I called her out, and asked to speak to a manager, she hung up............  

Have we really reached the point, when its considered Okay for British Gas staff to laugh at the difficulties of their clients, and 'cancel them' by hanging up on difficult calls??

The I wrote an online review, and within a couple of days, miraculously British Gas moved me back onto an EV tariff, and booked (for the third time) an engineer to install a smart meter - this was all confirmed at at 13:38 today.......

But alas, the elation didnt last long, because at 19:15 on the same day, British Gas sent me another email, to  inform me that i'm back on the Variable Tariff......

You honestly couldn't make it up!

If I could give no stars I would! As a new customer that's moved into a rental property... British gas have set me up on a Variable tariff. 

I have contacted them countless times to get an account number (which you cannot ring up to talk to them unless you have an account number to get passed the automated service), used live chat twice (told me to email them), I emailed them and the guy via email tells me to use live chat. It is literally like chasing your tail! 

Not one person at British Gas has a clue on a simple job! 

On top of that I cannot switch providers until I have spoken to someone at British Gas!

""Avoid British gas at all cost"" They didn't bring bill for almost 11 months when they finally brought it it was almost ¬£2000 for just gas. Prior to this I spoke to multiple staff to figure out if I was In debt they said no. Boom almost 2000¬£ debt. The staff are not well trained they seem very clueless on what is going on with my account. I decided to pay this debt on monthly direct debit which was set up by a member of thier staff, they said the debt was going to my credit score if I didn't pay before 1 year, I agreed to pay within 1 year. 2 months went by no money was taken from the direct debit, I contacted them again they said the debt was going to my credit score regardless of how I pay because I moved to another supplier which I was never told. I called them more than 10 times for them to please take the monthly agreed payment it was to no avail. It took months and staying on the line for multiple hours before this could be fixed. Then I moved my gas to another company by June 2023 they blocked it I called British gas to ask why I can't move they said they have rectified it I called the other company they said it is still blocked this is October 2023 I am still struggling with British gas on phone just to be able to move.  I am writing this review with a very sad heart because this company has caused me so much mental, emotional and physical stress and trauma that I still haven't gotten out of. I am still in shock how clueless the staffs are. If I could change the hand of clock I would never go close to a company like this. Such a nightmare.

There should be NO STARS. British Gas has APPALLING customer service. I received a FINAL BILL with the wrong meter reading. I called British Gas and gave them the correct meter reading and they sent me the amended bill which I PAID. Since then, the nightmare started. BG sent me again final bills changing the amount every time I called to say I have already paid. This has been going on for the last 2 months and it has still not been sorted yet. Every time I call them, which is every other day, they put me through various people (6-7 at a time) and they still cannot sort the problem on their side - as I have already paid the final bill. It takes me at least 1hr and 30mins - AT MINIMUM - to speak to someone who says they will reconcile the account.

British Gas Customer Service is absolutely shocking! You are waiting forever to get through to speak to a REAL person at BG & to top it off they play the most hideous loud torturous music down the phone, I swear they do it so you will hang up because you cannot take another second of it, and then after waiting forever! you then end up talking to someone in India! now dont get me wrong I do not care what country a person is from as long as they speak clearly & concisely & get the problem sorted out so please BS employ people who speak CLEAR English & who takes a breather in between every word, as they speak so very fast that it makes the call interaction at times unbearable, then after trying to understand best you can what they are saying they then start messing around having you wait for ages! And I can hear chattering and laughing in the background & I'm waiting on hold for eternity! It is as if they are doing it on purpose as if they are getting paid the longer they keep you on the phone for! And I was shouting down the phone hello, hello & stil i can hear chattering & laughing & and then they do this a couple of times, by coming on saying they are just sorting something out? What? God knows? Then next thing the horrendous loud fast music starts! by then you feel it is mental torture! You feel utterly stressed out, like you want to scream or cry and then next thing the phone goes dead!!!! And this has happened several times over several days all because you need to ringin BG to get any problems sorted out...

The different customer service people I spoke to seem to do not seem to fully understand your problem and the language barrier was so agonising no disrespect because they are obviously trying their best, but it is counter productive & not helpful at all & they did not seem very knowledgeable either & the waiting times & horrific music is just abysmal & then being passed around from pillar to post & then having your call dropped & a myriad of other issues makes British Gas Customer Service so utterly utterpy unbearable & is like mental torture!...

I did in the end get somewhere after days of trying & wasting hours & being put through torture, not properly sorted out, but somewhere hopefully on the way to getting fully sorted & that is when I tried again, having to go through the same agonising rigmoarole all over again but thankfully this person in India or South Africa because he sounded like it was a South African accent did speak clear and spoke more slowly & took his time & was very helpful which I told him i was very appreciative & grateful so hopefully i will get this matter fully resolved because dealing with BG Customer Service today is of Low standard & is a mentally torturous nightmare!...So much so that I want to find another company that has a high standard Customer Services & short waiting times with nice relaxing music that isnt too loud because how the elderly have to deal with this must be horrendous for them, I feel so sorry for the elderly today I really do, no one seems to care about those that cannot deal with the madness today....

Progress? Some things maybe but sometimes the old system can work much better...

I remember the days in the 1980s when Customer service in Britain was the BEST in the world sadly it has drastically declined and has become a nightmare for a lot of people who tell me the same thing.

BRITISH GAS SORT YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE OUT & BRING IT BACK UP TO HIGH STANDARDS INSTEAD OF GETTING CHEAP LABOUR YOU MAKE ENOUGH PROFITS!

This should be NO STARS.  The app is terrible, and has been this way since I joined the smart meter brigade.  When trying to top up my meter it jumps about goes off and back on then jumps around some more. I have had money taken from my bank account but not gone on meter, had to chase them up about it. Customer service need to have lessons how to talk to people. A few weeks ago I went away for 10 days with ¬£13  on meter which should have been enough for charges and fridge and freezer I topped up after being away for 8 days. When i returned home NO ELECTRIC food in fridge and freezer completely defrosted and ruined,  emergency did not trip in as I hadn't "" signed up"" for it. I thought that it would be done automatically.  Today I cannot top up online as the system is down AGAIN. Also not including the charges how am I using ¬£4 a day for just the fridge and freezer and tv. With occasional airfryer????????????????

I had to give 1 star to write a review. APPALING ! DISGRACEFUL! Customer service is absolutely APPALLING! British Gas made it their mission to be the worst in the business. Trying to speak to someone about a bill takes about 1h 30mins at MINIMUM per day and bear in mind, you need to call days on end to sort it out! Once you do manage to speak to someone, don't expect any help or solutions to your problems. It's as if they're reading from a script and have no ability to think. They show no empathy or understanding of your situation and seem more interested in passing the buck than actually resolving the issue.

British gas have contravened the BS standards on my installation.  No water checks were carried out so I had no heating from October until April. They carried out 4 power flushes to rectify but still the system is blocked. They admit that they do not carry out the water tests to the 7593 and do not check the PH balance even though the new rules are mandatory. The operations Manager did not know what the New Part L regs are so how are they being followed.  The customer now has to pay to put right the block caused from the magnetite sludge running through the system and causing the massive block. Do not use this company.

Absolutely disgusting company. I am on a prepayment meter and was struggling to top up both gas and electricity. Both were completely off supply. Also on the priority register. According to ofgem, in this situation energy supplier must support you with credit until you are able to top up. I was told to choose. They would only support me with gas OR electric. They proposed I went without gas or electricity supply over night. I have young children. 1.5 hours I spent on the phone and the woman caused me so much distress she made me shout, swear and eventually reduced me to tears. The phone was cut off so I called back, and spoke with a lovely lady who had no issues in providing support with both the gas and electricity. 2 hours it took for a resolution and a lot of unnecessary distress. Unfortunately my tenancy stipulates I cannot change suppliers, otherwise this would be my next step. British Gas, are arrogant, unhelpful and cruel

This is absolutely beyond satire; You may find this hard to believe: c Feb 2022, a letter from BG, 'Your new acc' with us...we'll write again soon'. Previous supplier (Together Energy) collapsed, as did many. *Note: Its OFFGEM who hand these accounts to alt' firms, without any consultation or choice of supplier!  More letters from BG. No speak of Direct Debit, so I write to them requesting they set one up. Ignored! Then, a ¬£470 bill. I phone (usual wait is c20-min's), I write. Next, a ¬£830 bill. More letters and calls from me. More junk mail from them!  In Sept 2022, I took it to Ombudsman Services. Late October, BG's own Ombudsman Complaints Team call: ""We apologise .......(etc etc), I will call back in two days to take card details and set-up a DD for you. She did, I quoted the card data, she advised ""1st payment on 3rd December"". On 6th Dec, I checked the bank acc: No payment AND no mention of BG on the account!  The bank's Fraud Team said ""It‚Äôs probably just an error from BG"".  By Xmas, an investigator at Ombudsman Services rang and said ""Yes, I agree with you; BG must follow these steps by (whatever date)"" and listed such steps. BG failed to implement one of them! More junk mail, more bills. I have ALL correspondence sent by me and received from BG; my own file on them!  One letter says 'we have a new system; You have a new acc' number', but they continue to use the old customer #! An address on the rear of bills has changed from Nottingham to Sheffield (or vice-versa), plus the return address on the rear of their envelopes is Winchester (though one is from elsewhere!)! Now, I have THREE new bills totalling ¬£6'300+. I have Citizens Advice on it and they're overloaded with this stuff!  *Incidentally, the Ombudsman Services are NOT a Gov agency as you may well assume, they are a company, a private concern. Yes folks, it‚Äôs all been privatised, not just the NHS! [To do this, I have to select star ratings on the RHS; I don't want to give this org' any stars, as others have said here.]

Only interested in money despite being funded by the British tax payer.  For them to announce profits of nearly ¬£1billion.  They pretend they care for you as a customer.  They will shut you up by saying the estimated bill is paid only to send you a document of another customers account contravening GDPR law via email.  Give you crazy estimated readings to the tune of ¬£3000 charge for less than a months gas for a 2 bed home.  My complaint with British gas is ongoing.  I have been on the phone numerous times, last call was after speaking for nearly 40minutes the Indian call centre lady said their manager will contact back after the weekend at 11am they never did. They are a pathetic excuse of a business.  Lies - don't go near them.  ""Looking after your World"" they really do not.

Just moved in to a property with prepaid meter and I was sent new smart card for gas which does not work to top up in the shops, online or with BG staff so unable to top up, have been calling daily up to 2 hours in my work time for over a week but appalling and insensitive response. Every time I call and explain all the story again to new staff and I was told it is referred to ‚Äòthe back office‚Äô or promised engineer would come last Friday but no one arrived and still nothing done and no answer about actual fault. Raised a complain which was closed by themselves without my knowledge and consent so when I raised it again, no response from management even though daily promised that someone will call back. Spoke to Emily today and Shirley yesterday. Can‚Äôt believe that management not interested even in complaints at all and feel stuck as when I requested to speak to the manager, I was told away or cannot until 48 hours and now it is a week. I was told that engineer can‚Äôt come until I have left ¬£2 in my account or run out so ensuring to make me suffer. Would never go back to them as learned a lesson so be careful.

British Gas are absolutely appalling. I've been trying to get my closing credit balance back for a home I moved out of on 12th August. I've rang at least 15 times to speak to someone in the home move team to be told each time its closed, subsequently its closed permanently except for them calling you back which takes 7-10 days. They closed my gas account but not my electric. I couldn't use their online acc system as I had cross over dates......I'm so frustrated, even spoke to someone in complaints who didn't raise it as a complaint.

I have finally left BG as I found the customer service was appalling, I‚Äôve joined Octopus who have been ever so helpful getting my DD set up and giving me a monthly bill so I can keep an eye on my bills, being a pensioner this is important being on a fixed income.
BG could do none of the above nor could they read the smart meter for my gas readings online again causing problems with my bills, although the price with Octopus for the gas and electricity is slightly higher for now there daily charge is a lot cheaper, people tend not to look at this but I recon I‚Äôm saving up to ¬£50 a year between the two companies, good bye BG hello Octopus.

This company absolutely stinks. I was transferred to them when my previous supplier went bust, I had no actual choice in the matter which in this day and age is ridiculous. My main gripe is their billing process which seems to be made up on the hoof; they create bills which they then go on to cancel then recreate in a new image, one that is very much in their own favour. 
The latest wheeze is to create a new app and website but to do this they again have decided to cancel my previous four bills (for which I have always provided my own meter readings) and concoct a new replacement bill based on the dreaded estimated readings which, yes you‚Äôve guessed it!, are far higher than my actual meter readings despite mine being taken a week after the estimates‚Ä¶
They‚Äôve badgered me ever since the switch into having a smart meter installed, at one point telling me it was mandatory and that if I refused they had the right not to supply me further and that I would not be allowed to find another supplier..! Considering that my wife has late stage cancer, and we are on the priority services register as a result of this, I thought this was an insensitive, if not callous, approach to customer service. A few weeks later we received an email apologising and admitting this had been an error and we NOT under any obligation to have the smart meter.
It‚Äôs a fact that energy companies have been having an absolute field day at the expense of their customers, bumper record breaking profits while hard up people are forced to choose between eating or freezing. Unfortunately the consumer has no real choice in choosing who provides their gas and electricity which has to be a failure of the so-called free market in this capitalist system. I could go on and on but with my blood pressure rising by the minute I think it best to sign off now. For British Gas, with their 12m customers, some of them a captive clientele, life has never been so rosy; for the rest of us life has never looked so bleak.

This started when my supplier went bust (Together Energy) November 2021 took British Gas 3 months to finally set me up on there system, happy days I thought!! Entered my meter readings for econ7 but online system wanted a third reading(strange I thought) so eventually did so. Got my 1st bill a month or so  later set up for econ7, was paying ¬£46.00 a month ( 1 bed flat electric only) bit steep I thought but kept it for a few months. Next bill come through showing I had used only ¬£22.00 that month so went to the recalculate option which brought down to ¬£25.00 a month, much better I thought. Online meter readings still asking for this 3rd reading. Next thing I'm getting an extra bill for a standard tariff of 100's pound's. March 2022 my deal from the Together Energy which British Gas had kept me on has ended and so my account. British Gas then me up a new account deleting all my old bills and from this on all I keep getting is one bill for standard tariff and one for econ7, after many, many, many calls we chats to Indian, now south African call centre's not one person can understand that I only have 1 meter for econ7, they seem to think I have 2 meters, don't log my readings only ever show estimates, have never shown dd payments only the amounts I'm supposed to owe, so ¬£750 and going up each month I currently have a complaint open (4th) and phoning once month as no one gets back to you as promised, threatening letters now turning up debt collection and all that
My next course of action is the ombudsman, though I don't think they'd be use from what reading

A circus tent held up by toothpicks

Atrocious customer service. Spoke to about 10 different people today, all passing the buck to another department. I literally just needed to confirm a few details for a home move but it's taken all day. I halfway finished setting up with one person, who then gave me the wrong tariff information. After I pointed it out and asked for the cheaper tariff, I was hung up on. I then received a cursory 1-second call-back-and-hang-up, assumedly so she could say she attempted a callback. Waited 40 more minutes for a real callback as assured by the robotic machine voice, didn't happen.

Was also promised ¬£150 credit for sticking with British gas. Nobody I've spoken to has been able to confirm this. At this point, I will probably be switching to a cheaper company with better customer service. The credit was the only reason I was staying with BG, but if they can't even deliver on their promises, there's no point putting myself through the hassle of this terrible customer service.

Also, your website logs me out after about 20 minutes every time, then I have to go through two pages to log back in. It's 2023, your website shouldn't be giving a 2005 customer experience.

Edit: Cancelled and went with Octopus. Set up in 36 minutes. Still waiting on that callback from British Gas. lmao

Edit: Since leaving British Gas, they've continually sent me threatening letters and emails regarding a ""final bill"" that was paid via their own website well before these started. Threatening to send a debt collection agency and then charge me for it. They don't list any phone number and make it as difficult as possible to contact them to say ""HEY! I PAID IT OVER A WEEK AGO!"" So glad I've left this utterly terrible company.

Edit 2: I spent an hour on the phone to an advisor who said that they would sort it out. Then I got an email saying that I paid the money on the new system but they needed me to pay it on the old system (???). They refunded my money to my bank account and have asked me to pay it again, but differently, but have not explained how paying it again will lead to a different result or how to pay it so that they'll actually accept the money. It seems like British Gas is deeply confused about their own processes and is passing that confusion on to the customer.

So, back on the phone I go for another hour to speak to more people who are more confused than I am.

Well, where do I start‚Ä¶ it was a dark cold day last October.. when my usage went from ¬£1400 a month to ¬£34,000‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a S‚Ä¶show since then..After sending numerous  of photos of a meter I believed to be faulty.. A case handler and a near nervous breakdown‚Ä¶ I complain to The energy Ombudsman.. who believe that there is a fault with the meter and go in my favour and we come to a agreement a check meter is to be fitted next to my original meter! (Yay) you think this would be the end of it, and all faults would be rectified and correct bill would be sent‚Ä¶ Ohhhh no no no IMserve come out to remove check meter and actually remove my ACTUAL ELECTRIC METER! On said day I phone both BG business and IMserve who both blame each other..shock horror apparently there was never a fault with electric meter IMserve removed‚Ä¶ even tho one rate never moved in several months and I was getting charged THOUSANDS a month (all estimated) these guys need to join the circus ü§° clowns.  still 11 months later NO bill‚Ä¶ incompetence at it worst, never have I experienced such awful dreadful service. I would give it a zero if possible.. They expect people to roll while they rob you. DO NOT USE THESE THIEVES

one hour on the phone/live chat. 4 different people and the fairly simple request of moving home and changing the account to the new property still unresolved. Infuriating and really stupid old/new system. Even when you explain to them exactly what the previous person told you, they start from scratch. and still not achieev anything. And then call you for a telephone survey of their customer services. not sure what they are thinking... just dreadful customer service.

COMPLAINT 05133302
British gas fraudulently merged my account with my relatives and took money from my direct debit to pay for her energy.
I filed a complaint well over a month ago about it and made numerous calls, emails and live chats trying to sort it but they never bothered so we both left british gas supply.
To this day the case handler PRIYANKA SALUNKE has ignored the complaint and repeatedly tried to forcibly close it down.
I wish I worked for british gas because clearly people like PRIYANKA get paid to SIT AND DO NOTHING ALL DAY.
After being on live chat 5 times since I am promised 'a response within 48 hours' which either doesnt happen at all, or is just priyanka trying to close the case down without ever bothering to reply.
The matter will now be escalated to the ombudsman as to why they used my account for someone elses address and took money from mine to pay someone elses bills and didnt sort it out.
All my emails = TOTALLY IGNORED.
Contacted them on social media, still not sorted.
SHOCKING.
Never did get the money back that they STOLE to pay someone elses bill. AVOID AVOID AVOID.

This Company should have the word British taken from them. They are a disgrace.
Warning, if you have solar, move to another company as they will look for ways to stop you generating your own power to you have to buy theirs.
April reported that my live smart meter data stopped recorded, rang countless times and told at least six different stories why this was happening, after 3 months asked for deadlock letter to find my complaint actually had just been binned.
Complaint reopened and engineer sent to my property to look at the meter, decided to replace but DESTROYED my solar set up in the process. Cost hundreds to get another firm out to connect back up safely When area Manager tasked to visit to review problems, couldnt be bothered coming and instead insinuated i was a liar and was intending to report my solar install which he said was illegal, total rubbish. Attempt to bully.
If had been a man, he would not have spoken to me in that threatening way to try to frighten me into not complaining. Meanwhile the new meter fails to give live data also.
They are a disgrace matter now with ombudsman and next its Court for these incompitent , discriminating, exploiters. Only stay with British Gas if you are happy to be overcharged, lied to, fobbed off threatened , discriminated against, and have deep pockets to pay electricians to repair your wiring and happy to have them frustrate your attempts to generate and use your own power.

I have spent 6 hours today trying to get an issue resolved with British Gas. The worst customer service I have ever received in my life. 
Evan after they have admitted they have ruined my credit file and potentially stopped my mortgage application they still haven‚Äôt resolved the issue. I spent hours talking to different customer service advisors today,passing me from one department to the next promising me a manager would call me soon. Despite them knowing the issue had to be resolved this evening to prevent me loosing my mortgage offer. The customer service advisors didn‚Äôt have any empathy or interest in my issue despite British Gas admitting fault. The only dispute on my credit file is a 7 month arrears payment due to them not closing an account when they switch me to pre payment ( a well known complaint throughout the country) I can‚Äôt Evan speak to anyone to deal with this as the online chat service is pointless and advisors just tell you it‚Äôs being processed and they understand my frustrations. Really? 
I have sent an email of complaint which has also come back with a response of 7-21 days‚Ä¶

After 18 months of hell with British gas, incorrect billing, refusal to respond, ridiculous responses from call handlers, etc, moved away from British gas and cleared the exorbitant bill of over 4K. British gas emailing for me to pay my final bill (of just a couple of weeks or so s supply) but emails didn't include amount or copy of bill. App closed to access, even though you declare the account is open to scrutiny for 6 months after closing. (good way to try and avoid scrutiny by ombudsmen). Call handler tells me no facility to email bill, and 5 weeks for paper bills. I ring again a few days later, and different call handler sends copy of bill within seconds. So much stress caused by something so basic, paying your utility bill.
Bills all paid, and was glad to get this dreadful company off my back. Now, contacted by a legal firm wanting a further ¬£28 for what? Rang the number, oh I can autopay!?!?

Becuase of COVID I needed to lock down with my family in order to provide care due to a disability. Well surprise surprise my gas usage for the last three years has been much lower than their estimates. So low in fact they refuse to accept them. 

The fact I have heating only and we have also had very mild winters and hot summers they also regard as a flimsy excuse. 

The gas stove is also an induction and I have an on demand system electric shower. Apparently they don't get why I am not using gas for anything. 

So I dutifully submitted date and time stamped photos. Which after 6 months of arguing were finally accepted. 

Only to see two weeks later that becuase there has been no rise in my meter for the last few months they have removed it and replaced with a huge estimate. That I have some how used ¬£2k in heat during the month of June! üò≥ 

Now having a south facing house with lots of windows that turn this into a greenhouse I could see spending this on air con. If I had that. But heat in June? During the hottest year on record? Hell no. I am constantly sweating. 

Talking to their customer service agent he informed that to get accurate bills the meter readings must be different each time. Submitted 7 days apart. And mine are all the same. 

I told him that's impossible. It's only heat. Not water. Not electrics. Not cooking. Just heat and not even all the rooms need it except on the coldest days. 

He told me nothing can be done and I will have to pay ¬£1k a month or turn the heating on full so they can see how much I use and readjust their estimate. 

I am one person in a tiny 2 bed house. How can I possibly use ¬£1k of gas a month. With a boiler that is turned off. 

The difference us huge. This is not a Smart meter it's an old meter. 

There is no meter reading error. 

My bill before COVID was ¬£65. 

Then after this I raised a complaint and got hostile emails threatening my with bailiffs if I don't continue paying. 

He said it was my fault for not using using enough heat and not being able to demonstrate 'weekly use in May to June'. 

He was rude, condescending and utterly clueless. 

I suggested then leaving and he said they will block me! I said what if I sell the house? He then said they will find me and sue me. 

I said for what? You have taken ¬£15k out if my bank account for gas I have not used? 

He said we can add more charges to your final bill. 

I said but I haven't seen the last two quarterly bills. Still waiting. 

Becuase 6 months ago the meter reading was accepted and it was going to be recalculated. With a refund sent. Nothing happened until now. And now it's worse. Back to square one again. 

The boiler is off for summer. No heat needed. I live in the south and it's hot!

This, is the, second review due to a long saga with this company.
They are trying to charge over ¬£650 for around 5 weeks supply after I paid a ¬£4k bill (due to them NOT billing me for 18 months, despite taking regular metre readings and making regular DDB payments, (eventually cancelled these) and refused to repay me the excessive credit in account, so I could close it and move to a different provider.(placedwith them after previous company went bust) Numerous calls to customer services, getting nowhere. I have now moved to different provider, and from mid April to 21 May, they are charging ¬£650. I live in the house on my own, and not even here all the time as was away working during that time. App to access as account says I can access for 6 months after closing, British gas have closed it so I can't check my records, they are emailing me threatening court action for this inflated bill, (for over 2 weeks telling me to pay, but no bill or notification of the amount) but insist they can't email me a copy of the bill, it will take 5 weeks for them to send a paper copy.

After contacting Citizens Advice they said to get a deadlock letter from British gas to make a formal complaint with the energy Ombusdman, currently they still have not replied to my request and still owe me money.

You can bet if I owed them money they would be sending collection agents to get it! 

Terrible customer service and illegal business practices.

have been a customer of British Gas for 20 years but am now at the point where I seriously would not recommend. I have not paid any electricity for the house I moved into in December, despite several phone conversations. This has really stressed me out as I worry the bill will be unaffordable when it comes through, I am very stressed out.

I recently had a new boiler fitted to replace one over 30 years old. The whole process was simple, fully explained and with strict time guidelines. The engineer was polite, tidy, skillful and utterly professional. There were a number of unexpected issues due to the age and construction of my flat, necessitating laying new pipes in inaccessible places, yet he dealt with all of these with aplomb and on great time. It was a totally stress-free 2 days (for me) and I wish to thank British Gas for that. I have read other reviews which differ from my experience, so I thought it important to let you know how happy I have been throughout with how I was treated and how the work progressed.

OK here goes, home care was due for renewal however I am also moving house a month later. Wanted to see if I could sort that. after eventually getting answered and through all the checks etc, I then needed to be transferred to another team and of course was cut off. I then tried again and the same happened. I then tried doing this on line but again had to talk to Ai and doing what I wanted was not possible on line. In total I spent just over 2 hours with no result. Out come, today I cancelled the renewal of my home care 4.  In the new house I will book a service with  a plumber and see where I go from there. I guess this has a lot to do with the world working from home?

DO NOT USE BRITISH GAS we have had the most awful experience with them.  The most stressful 3 months and a total lack of empathy shown by their complaints department.  The sold us a new water cylinder and boiler, told us it would take 2 days.  What they actually did was fit 2 faulty, leaking cylinders, fitted faulty valves, wired the boiler incorrectly, wrote a gas safe certificate for a boiler which was not working, left us with a boilet that sounds like a ship coming into dock when you turn on a tap, spent 3 months sending multiple gas fitters into our home, wasted water, heating, created damage through leaks,  lied about work being OK.  When we complained, the customer complaints department replied with two sentence replies and decided that a reduction of 6% on the bill was all we needed.  This has been a horrible experience.  I still don't feel that my boiler is safe.  All they care about is getting paid.  Horrible horrible experience

I moved over from octopus energy as I've owned a ev for 9 months & not able to charge at off peak cheaper rates as you can't read my smart meter. As a new customer you said I would have new British gas smart meters installed regardless of brand or condition of existing meters. Two months in after multiple cancelled install appointments, I'm now being told I might not require new smart meters. I'm still not able to use the off peak rates I signed upto & there doesn't seem to be a positive outcome in sight either.

You ask questions on their live chat and you never get a answer to your original question. When you log a complaint and tell them you are going to escalate your complaint to Ofcom,  the advisor tells you what Ofcom will say and how much they will offer to resolve your complaint,  British gas tried to pay ¬£20 compensation for their error but said if you go to Ofcom we won't give you the ¬£20, wow ¬£20 !!

If it was possible to give a single point on one star I'd have done it!
BG have to be the absolute worst energy provider I have been with and the "" customer service"" is an absolute joke!!!
I had my gas disconnected & capped of in November 2022 and contacted them to inform them of this and sent final reading on the meter, I then had the meter removed in March by BG to avoid the standing charge and have just been sent my new tariff with my expected usage for gas at 13,400 kW based on zero gas used since November!!!! They have also requested gas meter readings!!
My account was until recently over ¬£200 in credit but surprise surprise  since moving to the new system I am in debit of nearly ¬£1,000 for 3 weeks electricity!!!

I wanted to change my direct debit amount to make it less. The website doesn't allow that. You can only increase the amount. I tried to contact BG but could only find a call centre number to register a complaint. The person on the phone had difficulty with the English language and finding my account. Eventually she found the account, even though I had given it when asked by the automated greeting, but she couldn't deal with that request and would have to transfer me to another department which, I was told, had a long queue. At that point I gave up and transferred to OVO. BG's website is a shambles and BG obviously don't want to communicate. They have something called web chat but I couldn't find a way of getting to it. Clearly BG don't want their customers to interfere with their operation much less talk to them.

I have moved into a property recently, been in there a month. The previous tenants were under British Gas. Called BG the first night I slept there and told them i‚Äôm the new tenant and I‚Äôll be switching providers, the call person didn‚Äôt like that and BEGGED me to stay. I said no and I told him that any previous debt legally has to be written off because it isn‚Äôt mine to pay since I haven‚Äôt used ANY electricity or gas. The guy eventually agreed and said he sort it out on the system. I switched providers after 2 weeks of living there. The day I switched BG sent me a message saying I owed ¬£16, give or take a few pennies. I was about to pay them today because it‚Äôs payday! It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I switched providers. While on the phone to pay BG I get a text saying I now owe them ¬£30. I ignored it because it‚Äôs not true. Within 1 minute, no word of lie, I get an email from BG that says I owe them ¬£52. I‚Äôve lived in the property for a month. Switched 2 week after moving in. At most I use 4 hours worth of electricity a day because I have baby groups  and appointments daily to attend to. How in all of the land of the sane can I owe ¬£52? The day I moved into the property the meter said ¬£80 and 3 days later I checked the meter it said ¬£0 so there‚Äôs no way that the ¬£52 was the previous bill. I don‚Äôt understand. How do people use or recommend British Gas? British Gas need to take a long walk off a short pier with 50 tonne weights chained to their ankles, being money hungry is disgusting and evil

Charging twice for the same period
When my daughter moved out of my rental property in Sept 2022 I contacted British Gas, the supplier, to let them know I would be paying the bills from now on until I'd sold the property.
The bills kept arriving monthly to The Occupier, I paid them. The last one being December 2022.
In February 2023 I contacted British Gas to let them know I'd sold the property and please could they send me a final bill.
So they closed The Occupiers account, opened a new account- backdated it to September 2022!
I queried this several time as I didn't see why or how British gas could charge again for a portion of energy that had already been paid for?
Eventually I spoke with a lady for nearly an hour, who in the end, promised me I had nothing to pay and that the account was now closed.
A few days/weeks later I received an email and letter from a debt collection agency for the full amount- backdated to September 2022 and no government subsidy deducted.

I have requested a Deadlock letter at least 6 times as I would pay the bill then take it up with Ofgem
So far they have completely ignored my request for the Deadlock letter - so I cannot move forward with Ofgem!

Apparently they are sorting out my invoices now... but I imagine in the meantime I'll end up with a bad credit rating due to their ineptitude.

Date of experience: 22 March 2023

Absolutely rubbish customer services, smart meter gone off plus top ups wont go on have to input manually i called them 12 days ago they said wait 7 days it will reconnect automatically, which it hasn't and now after 12 days they are saying wait 10 days for them to raise a ticket then ill have to wait another few weeks for them to get an engineer out which is what i asked for originally, so a month down the line and my problems still not sorted, i mean its not like they should be short of staff because with the price of gas and electric we pay they should be a little bit more on top of things. When they want money off us can we say we wait 7 days and if its not in your account call us back then ill raise a ticket and then you will have to wait another 10 days.....  Really ....
and then the way they spoke to me i told them it was hard for my wife to move furniture to manually put the top up voucher code in to the meters because she is disabled and they asked what her disability was... im glad it was an online chat as i screen shot all the chat so if anyone would like to see it i have proof

Twice over the last 18 months I have asked British Gas engineers out to do a service ( not a reporting a fault)  for a boiler and twice the boiler has broken down hours after the service was completed .
Until the two visits these boilers had been working .In one case not very well in an old system but  still functioning and in the other a boiler only a year old and working perfectly. I find this incredible .All this can be verified by British Gas service records .In neither case had I touched the two boilers concerned .For a period of ten years previously I had no complaint with the service I received from British Gas and I am baffled at to why this should suddenly have changed .

This company BRITISH GAS AND DYNO ROD broke the floor, walls of my house and did a lot of damage and cheated. Guys please be careful.
I have had Home care 4 For Boiler , central heating, gas , electric contracts with this company.  Payment for each month was ¬£48 . I call them when I have problems with the boiler pressure in my house.  Unfortunately, In the name of work, the destroyed my entire kitchen in my house , the bathroom floor , kitchen floor and removed my entire kitchen base unit. they did checking to find the pipe leaks for about 4 weeks, put holes in about five different places in my house and suddenly stop working and disappear.  When contacted later, I was told that my pipe work was not done properly by the previous workers so they could not come back to do the work.  My question is, why didn‚Äôt they tell me after the first 2-3!days that they couldn't continue my work for that reason.  Then at least I would have no damage in my property. In this damage condition of my house they left me without hot water and heating .  I have communicated to them through written letter but no solution till now.  I am living in very bad condition without hot water and heating with my family including small children‚Äôs .I just want to say that I will take them to court for the damage they have caused me in the name of doing my pipe work.  Please beware of such scams.  But I believe there are still many good companies in this line, who are honest and trustworthy

Come the swap day my gas got swapped and I was told on that day a member of British gas  added it as DEBT! I told them I only took the ¬£20 as when I first joined yous failed to give me a top up card for 3 days. The day I got the card numbers I topped up ¬£100! After almost 8 weeks of promised call backs and managers lies. I got a manager to listen to that call. Once again no call back and I had to chase this up, finally a lovely woman found the issue seen I called and refunded me. Once again I TOLD yous to ACCEPT MY SWAP ASAP  as due to the emotional stress and leg work I had to do I wasn't going to give yous anymore money! The one day when it was cold I went into my emergency and thay convently when yous tried so once again stopped due to 1.98 of debt! I called and was told they need to investigate my debt!! I already done it for you and so did the woman! Now edf have told me they are no longer going to try and now I have a gas meter on pay as you go with a company who refused to take blame and a dry meter with EDF this needs to be sorted!!!!

I paid my gas bill a week before it was due.  They then took my dd out so now 1000 pound took out.  I spoke to them immediately told me to speak to my bank as if they were to refund it would cost me about 200.  I went into my bank but couldn‚Äôt do anything as not same day.  Spent ages on phone to my bank and said need to speak to bags.  Spoke to bags again and they said will refund gas but refunded electricity which I didn‚Äôt want.  Still waiting for refund.  Has really affected me with my finances and struggling but stress of this is absolutely terrible

1 star is 1 too many. Had an appointment to remove my gas meter and supply in May 2022. They cancelled 2 days before due to lack of engineers. Contacted them back after they never rescheduled, eventually getting a new date in January 23. Was told I would not have to pay standing charge they were still charging me. After 3 or 4 complaints finally getting a letter telling me I can basically get stuffed. So I now have to pay 7.5 months standing charge, approx ¬£95, for their inability to complete on their obligations. DIsgusted customer

Doesn't deserve any stars!! Please explain how such a company is still running?
I am so angry!! I can hardly be civil.  I moved into a new premises and  I changed suppliers straight away from British Gas, m because I just absolute hate British Gas. Glad I did because they have proved me right!  I got a final bill before it changed over for ¬£202.57 for a period of 7 days. No idea how it was this expensive. I  tried to get an explanation as to why it was this expensive. Instead got a solicitors letter threatening me to pay the bill.  Please be extremely carful when dealing with this company!! I would defiantly avoid all costs.

I'm pretty sure their online 'chat' is just bots.. I wish I could have put a transcript of our conversation here. They are unknowledgeable, slow, and they do not care. I have been having an issue with my meter and no matter what I say to them they just move onto the next scripted question. It's so tough to even talk to them. After talking to one guy 'Sakshi' for about 20 minutes about my electric meter, with him giving me random advice, he then asked me if my issue is regarding my gas or electricity meter. I mean, that was it, I just quit the chat. Absolutely useless.

There are serious issues surrounding the honesty and integrity of this company..

1. In July 2020 I spoke with a rep on the phone who claimed I potentially owed 4K for 3 months energy usage. Which is impossible in a terraced house! Left me worrying for 8 months with no response to the complaint I lodged with them. I sold the property & they refunded me ¬£125 as it transpired I was actually in credit & owed nothing! No apology or explanation given after months of chasing!

2. Sold my property, provided meter reads which photographic evidence of this. Moved to my new property in June 22. In sept 22 recieved a bill for 2.5k for the month April - may.. it‚Äôs not possible to use a years supply in a terrace house in one month! Called them, was told they billed ME simply because they didn‚Äôt have the details of the new owner. had to waste more time & calls at my own expense to sort‚Ä¶ again. Made another complaint that again I received no response to. I didn‚Äôt even own the house anymore & British gas were aware, but chose to bill ME anyway! Apologised & wiped the bill after another 2 weeks of chasing. 

3. Raised my direct debit to ¬£250 with no explanation. It transpired I was only using ¬£120 - ¬£140 a month. Took so much extra money that I ended up almost ¬£600 in credit over 3 months! British has kept this money until I demanded it back & changed my direct debit to reflect my usage. No doubt gaining interest in their account for months. Then a month later tried to suggest I raise my direct debit to ¬£418! I called again, was told this was an error on my account‚Ä¶ again. Apologised & refunded after more weeks of chasing. 

4. In October 22 the monthly bill went back up to almost ¬£400‚Ä¶ from ¬£250. Again no explanation. So I tested this bill. I turned my central heating on in November.. bill was ¬£400. Turned it off ever since & the bill was STILL almost ¬£400, work that one out? 

5. Realised I was the subject of a scam somewhere along the line so I tracked my usage using the app.. my bill bizarrely did not reflect the stated usage on the app & there was an additional ¬£120-¬£180 being added to my bill monthly with again, NO explanation. 

6. Left British gas because I would be crazy to stay after all the issues highlighted above. switched to EON. EONs bill for the month? ¬£180! 
So why was my bill with British gas so high? 

7. Recieved the final bill from British gas‚Ä¶ gas ¬£149 for 1.5 week of usage! Electric ¬£84 (I‚Äôd insert a laughing emoji if I could) this is with no central heating being turned on & the gas is only used to heat the bath/shower/sink once ever other day (we shower at work) I called & made yet another complaint. Now getting a refund & owe nothing‚Ä¶ but had I not called them I would‚Äôve had to pay this fictitious bill! Again, apologised & refund issued after another week of chasing them. 

8. Parents are elderly & own a very large 6 bed house, their bill for the month? ¬£230.. with central heating on daily & no benefits coming in aside from pensions (EON) I own a 4 bed house, no central heating on bar one month of the year, my bill? ¬£400! (British gas) 

DO NOT use this company unless you want to pay a variety of fictitious charges that you do not legitimately owe! Thankfully since I realised British gas were scamming me somewhere along the line & have been gathering evidence ever since. I feel extremely confident with the evidence I have been keeping since last year that winning in court would not be an issue according to my solicitor. 

Please save your money & go with EON, octopus, utility warehouse etc. 
the customer service is better, you will save a lot of money, you can avoid being scammed by British gas & complaints are responded to in a timely manner.. as opposed to not at all & you are not subject to imaginary charges that have clearly been completely made up by British gas! Awful experience, after being a loyal customer for over 8 years previously, I will never return to British gas, EVER.

Where do I start, extortionate pricing for gas & electric, incorrect billing leading to incorrect credit that was promised, then this was used again a bill to allegedly bring the bill up to date (even though we paid 6 monthly and had just paid 3 months previously) the bill after 3 months was the same amount as the 6 monthly bill. I understand pricing are going up but not doubling after previously doubling in early 2022. The credit reduction which we were then promised was held to be used against our account as the new amended Direct Debit (reduced as we were paying to much) we found out wan't actually enough to pay our next bill ??? no-one can seem to work out the cost and calculate a 6 month DD to cover it. I also provide meter readings as clearly their estimates were way off. I then go to submit my next reading the its lower than a reading taken mid-month which wasn't provided by me and my husband - so who provided this to them? according to the auto message it was from me. Not by my emails and photographs of readings it wasn't - its a joke I am delighted I am now moving to Octopus after many recommendations

Woefully inadequate.
It took British Gas three months and several attempts to 'set up' a direct debit (which, incidentally had been fully operational for many years).

Repeated email complaints and requests, coupled with online chats failed to fix the error and I was forced into potential arrears with the prospect of being forcibly transferred to a more expensive prepayment option via their abuse of the legal system. Finally I had to work around their incompetence by settling the bills outside of their direct debit system.
No operative had any understanding of the problems they themselves had caused, nor how to rectify them, and  the promised telephone call from a 'specialist' never materialized.
Repeatedly, emails were responded to with auto response promises of a detailed response from a manager, and again such detailed responses were not forthcoming.

Complaints and problems were generally either not addressed, or were summarily dismissed by the operatives against whom the complaints were made.

Today I have changed my gas supplier, and received from British Gas a patronizing public response PR exercise expressing their 'sadness' at losing me as customer and asking if they could do more, when a more honest question would be, could they have done less'.

Undertrained or underqualified staff, aided and abetted or encouraged by feeble and cowardly management indicate that British Gas has a customer relations model unfit for purpose, which may go some way to explaining their loss of hundreds of thousands of customers over the past few years

They are a complete and utter shambles of an organisation who are in dire need of shutting down. You write to them and hear nothing, you contact them and they say they can not help, you then ask them what to do because they are going to start legal proceedings and they say they can not help. They are a complete and utter shambles. I really can not begin to stress how bad they are and how they should be avoided at all costs. You deal with them, let the buyer be aware of the incompetence they will subject themselves to.

Appalling customer service. I moved home and the current provider there was British Gas. I was staying with my existing supplier so was waiting for that to go though. In that time, gas and electricity supply was disconnected due to fault. I couldn't move in as BG refused to help. Ok, so I waited and once switch was complete, new provider sent electrician out to fix. BG then had the audacity to send me a bill for nearly ¬£150 even though I had NO SUPPLY in that time at all! I spent hours trying to get through the automated service and when I eventually spoke to someone, they didn't know what to do and put me back to the automated system. Went round in circles for hours. No one helps, the automated system is the worse iv ever experienced and they don't reply to complaints either.

Tried to take over a gas supply currently with British Gas and gave up in the end and went with SoEnergy who we are with at another property . 
Can't really be bothered going into great detail but basically trying to navigate the website is difficult as the choices don't seem to be relevant to what I wanted , then given a phone number to call and ended speaking to someone thousands of miles away ( with a very poor line which it always is )who then says they will put me through  to the home move team and then they don't answer and after three minutes the person Im speaking to tells me that after three minutes it will be cut off and I will have to call again !
So British Gas why can't you just answer the phone in a normal manner and get through to an intelligible representative as you used to do and sort the issue out , surely its quite a simple thing to do surely ? Or set up offices as in the good old days !! I don't mind paying a little bit more to get a proper service !  because at the moment you are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!!!

Sept 2021 my elec reading cud not be accepted by bg online a/c, this went on for over a year and every month i had to send them a foto of my meter to prove the reading. In june 2022 bg deceided to change my meter. Job done or not as the bills they sent me were non sensical.  I went to the ombudsman who accepted my case.  BG agreed to do the 3 things that the ombusman told them to do. (1) apologise for my inconvenience ( they sent the letter to the ombudsman and not me) (2) put the meter reading (for billing purposes)back to the correct number and (3) pay me compensation ( credited to bill).  I assumed rightly or now wrongly that if my account was corrected that i would receive a correct up to date bill - not so. The bill had at least 20 items on it both debits and credits, the latter outweighed the debits by ¬£200+ but did not add up to the final figure shown. I went back to the onbudsman who told me to contact the person who wrote the letter of apology  this i did 2 wks ago but the agent answering the fone cud only send him an email to ask him to contact me. Today i chased them again only to find out the person who wrote me the apology letter (17/1/23) had not been at bg for some time! (Do they have robots writing letters now?). I asked 2 speak to his boss - sorry can't  put you thru but i can email him an ask him 2 ring you (dejavu). I now wait for him (or a robot) to contact me but in the meantime have raised yet another complaint with bg and if nothing heard will go back to the ombudsman. Incidentally the person/dept i need to speak to is customer relations - believe  me if it weren't  for the energy crisis i wudve sacked off bg a long time ago and had NO relations with them at all. I do sympathise with all bg complainants and urge you to go to the ombudsman.

Absolute rubbish. I Have tried to obtain a bill and have used the on line chat. The call centre is based in India and they are very difficult to communicate with, finally I chatted with a supervisor named Fauzi he was a devious twisted individual who tried as hard as possible to get me to pay by direct debit and suggesting that the Government rebate had not been received by British Gas. All fantasy they are tasked with bringing in as much money without regard to the customers financial position or requirement for the service.

Poor management and a lack of professionalism are my experience of British Gas.

Where do you even begin, I was lied to about the amount I would pay, promised a deal that never materialised and then it changed without consent once the contract was signed. I have had ongoing problems, the recent:

I had a direct debit set up, I was in credit, they then suddenly pushed up my DD without letting me know, not by a small amount either. This caused huge financial problems as they wiped my bank account clean, which meant there was no money to pay other bills, including rent. I was then told it would go back to the original DD. It took 3 months to resolve this issue. 

I paid in extra each month, on top of my DD to make sure I wouldn't be hit with a huge bill all at once. While I continued making extra payments, they stopped taking the direct debit, for months, never told me, the DD was still active; and as a result, I ended up with a massive bill. (6 months of not taking payment) Again, they pushed up my DD without telling me, cleared my account, again, and claimed they did tell me of the changes (in small print in a random emails that had nothing to do with payments and billing.) and the reason they didn't take the DD, because I was making extra payments too close to the DD date and it was withheld; ummm!! What???

A year later, after having to go through Citizens Advice to get that complaint addressed, I was assured it was all sorted, I am back where I started. Same problems, they added an extra payment onto my DD without telling me, to clear this massive bill, (that they created by not taking DD payments.) I have spoken to 6 different people over 3 weeks, not including the 4 hours today on the phone, nothing is resolved. More lies, a long list of excuses, even more lies, no responsibility, not my department, I didn't talk to you, I never did this, I never did that. And then the pure joy of dealing with a 'snowflake' who can't deal with anything that's 'negative and too much like hard work'. So, here I am, the one who has to pay the price both financially and personally because of this poorly managed company, with incompetent dishonest staff can't work to a basic standard.

British Gas, is a perfect example of how broken, and rapidly declining Britain has become.  Poor service, duplicity, incompetence and a profound lack of responsibility, culpability and accountability. It's not just the government, it's the entire infrastructure and mentality of the society. A society unwilling to get their hands dirty and make the changes so desperately needed, a society that has allowed this sickness to take root, spread and prevail.

I had British Gas round to talk about installing a new boiler.  I was told it would be installed in 3 weeks but the guy who came round wanted to confirm a few things with the fitter.  That was in the middle of November.  It's now Feb 6th and  I'm still waiting despite chasing several times.  If this is the service you get before they get your money, I can only imagine the after care service.  Certainly won't be using them!

What a shame.  They are doing millions in profits and can't even install or do a little job for the costumer I'm waiting already for a job done 3 months and just got an engineer telling me to rebook my appointment because the system is down.  Come on 80 millions profits is not enough to solve this?

Ah, what can I say about British Gas, or Brutish Gas as I affectionately call them? If you want to be bullied and harassed by a company, British Gas is the ideal place to go for your gas and electricity. It's full of staff who give you contradictory information, many of whom have the remarkable ability to talk out of their posterior while sitting on it.
Did I mention this British icon's knack for sending dodgy bills that make no sense? And their communication skills are something to behold. Wrongly threatening you with court action and entirely unjustly adding charges to bills. That's just the kind of stress you're missing in your life.
Being a customer of British Gas is quite the experience of incompetence or willful deceit  (after over two-and-half years I'm still not entirely sure which applies, though I am increasingly coming down on one side), where important information is sent to the wrong address.
Oh and they can gaslight you like the sleaziest of sleazy dates. Indeed, there are strains of domestic abuse in this relationship. One party has all the power; the weaker one begs them to be nice, play fair and not steal the money they're not entitled to. 
How do you escape this entirely imbalanced relationship? I'm still trying... It might take me some time, but I'll make it.
To be fair, I have come across some kind, empathetic, knowledgeable British Gas staff who aren't rude and try to correct the work of more ill-informed colleagues. But my goodness, they are hard to get to.
If this is what you're looking for in your energy company, go right ahead and sign up. If not, run like the wind and don't look back.

Oct 2021 sadly moved from Peoples Energy to BG, meter reading provided (have email confirming) Jan 22 bill raised and paid Feb bill raised and complaint put in electric meter proven to be 40% fail rate hence high electric bill. Smart Meters fitted gas and electric within 2 days smart meter box not reading failure to connect numerous calls to BG-switch it off turn it back on!!! They said not to worry as they were still receiving readings‚Ä¶ fast forward to Jul smart meters not providing readings to BG estimated horrific bills raised, reversed sorted, raised reversed and confirmed correct by numerous members of the BG team. Finally a nice person Sept who reversed every single bill and gave me correct balance which was paid. New smart meters fitted 03 Jan 23 all seemed ok UNTIL bill they backdated my bill from Oct 21-Jan 23 over 7k leaving me a debit of over ¬£3900 to be paid by Feb 14!! Back to back calls and was told well that‚Äôs what you have used however it‚Äôs 3x above the average household.

At a loss as can‚Äôt go to OFGEM without deadlock letter and every couple of days I receive a higher debit.

Can an engineer phone us? We would like a proper explanation as to why our heating has not been working since December 2022 and you have still not fixed it and are now unable to do so until February 14 2023? Your customer service is non existent and your ability to provide the service you promise is sadly inadequate.

I told them i had payed ¬£530 already (they said i hadn't and that they had refunded it back to me ) bank statements ect later to prove  i had payed them ....I argued and said just put me on a pre payment meter as i carnt do with the stress. 

Meter put in and they said it needed a change as it was faulty , then they have the cheek to put another debt on it of ¬£550 ,
I had to argued again and take it to the odbusmen this time they said they owed me ¬£350 ..'really' ..then from then it still went on to more stress !!!! ..i couldn't top up the smart metre ...4 months of ringing every Monday for them to say ""we have loged your complaint and WILL get someone to call you back "" NO ONE EVER CALLS BACK ....Week later i call again ,""We can see you have a complaint issued so we carnt talk to you THEY will call you back"" 
REALLY (that just never happens )......4 months and no one has called back ... and a total of 39 hours of Recorded calls to -date and the issue still hasn't been resolved (they have also held me hostage since December now so i carnt leave the company either due to the machine not givinga reading ) .......Please i beg you DO NOT CHANGE TO THEM as there customer service is horendus ..x

Absolute embarrassment of a company. Should not be allowed to use the name 'British'. I hope this does not typify the standard of service bestowed on the British public. Simply wanted to (as a Landlord) inform them that we have had a change of tenant & would like to give them all the details & meter readings. Will not allow you to speak to someone on the phone & keep trying to link you to webpage or want to text you a link to a form. None of these will accept my number (I live in Australia but my property is in Scotland). Keep cutting you off when you don't have an account number or phone number linked to the account (the last tenants switched & set it up). Spent 2 1/2 hours trying to sort this out through the chat consul (which I have copied to send to the Ombudsman). The Directors of this company are to blame as they only care about shareholders. Hopefully it will catch up with this sorry shower & the public will talk with their feet & go elsewhere. Feel it is a bit misleading as I can't give them less than 1 star.

We pay a monthly fee to include breakdowns and servicing. Book a service on line on 11/12/22, nearest appointment date was 16/1/23 with a time frame between 12:00 - 18:00. My wife re-arranged her day to facilitate the appointment and waited in all afternoon. I arrived home to find that there was a no show, the engineer didn‚Äôt even call, which is their supposed policy. I contacted British Gas through the automated service. The response was their engineers were busy on emergencies, and then offered a new appointment date two weeks later. Which we reluctantly accepted.
The biggest gripe is ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.If you pay for a service‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..you expect to get a service, also for the engineer or British Gas not to call is a disgrace.

Boiler stopped working Saturday morning 14th Jan 23 - stayed in lock out no matter how much I tried to fire the burner. Called Homecare. Engineer booked to come out by 11am the same morning! 5 stars for that. Waited and waited and was updated by sms to say delayed and now likely after 6pm. 7pm he turned up. 4 stars now but still great service. He was also to do its annual service (after 15 months). About 5 minutes later he came out of the boiler room to declare that the heat exchanger was leaking and causing the sensors to trip out. He would try and fix it on a temporary basis but basically needed a new boiler (15 years old) About 15 mins later he re-emerged to say that the water was running down the electrical connections and it couldn't be made to work. He explained the boiler is obsolete and there are no parts available so he would report in to his dept on Monday to get a quote out for a new boiler. On the form left under 'parts ordered today' he had written main heat ex (obsolete) I have read of others complaining that BG were basically telling customers their boilers were obsolete and so I thought I would look up the specific part declared as obsolete. Guess what? 20 minutes research online found a supplier of spare parts and using the supplied parts manual identified the precise model replacement heat exchanger. It's around ¬£360. Under my Homecover BG are supposed to repair my boiler at THEIR cost. Easy to say the boiler is obsolete and avoid doing so.  It is going to get interesting as I have ordered the part

My boiler failed 21 December 2022, logged on to my homecare account and the earliest appointment was January 11th 2023. I know it is Christmas but 21 days for an engineer is appalling, do they expect me and my family to go without heat or hot water for 21 days. Had to get a new boiler from a local plumber, fitted next day.

BG are an absolute disgrace. After transferring from People's Energy (not by choice) they have got my first bill wrong 9 timed. Every time I managed to sort it they would then retract the bill a fee weeks later and issue another bill with no notification. It was only through constant checking that I kept noticing that they had changed it and had to spend hours on the phone each time for them to sort. Finally, managed to sort in August and was promised it wouldn't change which thankfully it didn't. However, I then received a new bill in January and I was over ¬£250 in credit as I was overpaying (which I told them over and over again I was). I decided to leave this in my account and the app said that I could reduced my direct debit slightly which I decided to do. The next day, I check my account again (because I have zero trust in them) and sure enough, they've take another ¬£154 with no explanation (just taken from my account credit) and the app now says I'm not paying enough.
I've totally had enough of them. They just feel that they can take whatever money they want with no explanation or contact.
Worst company ever - I would never recommend them to anyone. As soon as I get the money back that they have stolen, we will be moving to somewhere else.

British Gas are worse than cowboys. I bought a new boiler from them at over ¬£3k in 2018, subject to a five year warranty, which they unilaterally terminated after four and a half years. To make matters worse, the boiler packed up completely shortly afterwards, and I had to spend another ¬£3k replacing it. If you want a new boiler with a warranty DO NOT go anywhere near British Gas - their warranties are worthless

Unfortunately after many years of trying to find a different company to service our boiler, we have decided to purchase a new one. (Not BG) On reflection on the Homecare service we have had from Britsh gas its a mixed review. 
Engineers, like most companies its the luck of the draw, sometimes you get them who know what there doing, do the service and leave it in a better condition and you get them that after a service its in a worse state and you have to pay again to get it fixed. Unfortunately with BG it mostly the latter. 
Phone
Not the best, a average wait of 40 minutes is the norm to talk to anyone.

The yearly service is more like the 15 month service.

confidence is low due to the many problems we have had , just after a service.

Good evening
Please treat this as a formal complaint, which I will also make through your online channels and by telephone when your call centre opens at 9am. I am putting it here too so people considering taking out your services or renewing them can be aware of your poor service levels and the obvious contempt you have for your customers and, to a degree your staff, as you do not equip them with what is needed to respond to customer queries. I will detail the background to the complaint and the steps I would like you to take to put it right. I have been a long standing homecare customer for well over a decade and have always thought it provided a good service and peace of mind when there is a problem. Your service is a very poor imitation of what it once was, and on today‚Äôs experience, pathetic and not fit for purpose and the ¬£300 a year charge.
Our boiler broke on Tuesday evening and we have no means of heating or hot water. I logged on to the system and booked the first available appointment of Thursday between 8am to 6pm. My partner has taken a day off work to wait for the engineer to arrive. He is self employed and lost income for the day. It got to late afternoon and we were expecting to be told the engineer would be with us on the next call. I called the call centre to see where we were in the queue. You were unable to provide any information - please consider why you have a call centre if you cannot deal with basic queries such as the arrival time of an engineer. I asked what I should do if the engineer did not arrive as expected. I was assured this was unlikely to be the case but if this did happen I would be notified and a prompt resolution offered. At 5.45 approximately, I received a call at work which went to voice mail. In the call you offered no apology and advised an engineer has been rescheduled for Sunday. Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Friday - why are we not at the top of the queue for a rescheduled appointment. On the performance of today, there is no point me having boiler cover - I pay for this so any problem can be resolved quickly. I would have been better advised to not pay for boiler cover and call a local engineer. 
This is what I would like you to do to resolve this complaint. 
1. You have failed to fulfill your appointment commitment. I should not have to wait until Sunday, you should be offering an appointment as soon as possible, in this case Friday morning.
2. Details of how to claim for a days lost earnings.
I await your response. I hope some of your senior leadership team read this review and reflect on how your service levels have deteriorated. This used to be an exemplar service and is now shockingly bad on todays experience.

Simply shocking customer service designed to avoid you getting anything changed. Patronising staff, which gets worse the higher up you go.  Now they have changed their Energy account website, I can't even access the data I need. They won't even pay me back the Government rebate, rather they add it to my credit. They have hung up on me twice.  I have used Live chat, telephone and they even gave me a specific e.mail to write to, from which I have never had a reply. Letter to Ombudsman being written now. As soon as I can, I will get out of the service that these money grabbing leaches provide.

Shocking customer service, incompetent operators on the live chat, and invalid information.

Im now 195 in the que for the second time today, trying to find out why i have not received my government support payments.

The first chat ended with me being told to contact the operator of my electric key meter, i asked they check if it was BG before i logged off they said no. I then contacted northern power grid who immediately told me its BG , and that they have access to the same database , and have supplied the property since 2011.

Previously when i contacted British gas about billing, the chat operator gave me different information to the call operator on the phone earlier that day.
The app also had different information from both the chat operator and the telephone operator.

The phone lines are closed again today.

Terrible company avoid like the plaque.

Appalled with the level of customer service, time off work with promises of call backs. Getting fobbed off by incompetent staff, just getting told the same thing time and time again, Late engineers, not refunded money as an issue with the meter from previous customer. Not even responded to the 4 complaints made. Appalling level of service. British gas should be embarrassed and don't deserve the right to be called British gas... Nothing but a tin pot money grabbing set of cowboys.

British gas have been taking money from my bank account for 4 years without my knowledge for policy for boiler care and drains without my knowledge from my bank account. The amount was ¬£11.64 pence they just did automatic renewal.
This company are crooks do not use. Because the amount was very little I didn't notice . Even the customer service team were really rude. Can a company steal money without your consent really terrible company I give them rating of -0. I definitely will be taking legal advice also writing to the ombudsman about this criminal company I didn't realise the British gas is a cowboy company. After stealing money from my account for 4 years they offered my 98 pounds I would advise customers to stay away from this company

I would give them zero stars if I could. Awful customer service, terrible and incompetent engineers, ni sympathy, rude, unprofessional to say the least. The phone advisor was so fake over the phone to the point of insult, engineer turned up next day to change my smart meter, spend 1 hour at my property, didn't bother checking if the appliances actually work after installation, left and I realized there was no hot water, heating or gas. Spent 2 hours at useless customer service phone, being in hold for 45 mins only to be told their office is closed for the bank holiday weekend.
Had to spend 60 pounds on private engineer to fix the mistake of incompetent engineer only for another rude, unsympathetic one to turn up 4 hours later to say sorry and not even mean it.
British gas is the worst energy provider ever, I will highly discourage anyone to sign up with them, even if they offer a good deal. It is worth paying extra and have the piece of mind.

Non existent, terrible customer service, British Gas are money grabbers who never ever want to refund your money, even when you are entitled to a refund. They never do what their agents will tell you will be done over the phone. When you ring them again for the 100th time, you'll have to explain yourself from square 1, because their customer service reps haven't taken proper notes of your problem/query. Their customer service reps are incompetent and unable to complete very basic tasks. Worse some of their reps just want to argue with customers instead of sorting the problem out, and they will just pass you onto another department where you will be put on hold once again, and once again will have to start all over explaining your issue. This is a very unprofessional company that are dishonest and greedy and they hoard people's money. They need to be reported and investigated.

Spoke to British Gas for the 5th time since leaving them in October, still not received refund for account being in credit, was in credit by a substantial amount now they are trying to say it‚Äôs only in credit by ¬£100 and taken over a ¬£1000 off, bearing in mind no one has been living in the property for about 5 months and prior to that only at property 1 day a week due to work commitments. The assistants I spoke to at the beginning both gave the same amount to be refunded and the second had said it‚Äôs taking awhile as it needed to be approved as it was a large sum and that it had been approved and should be with you within 14 working days 3 -4 weeks on and no refund so called today and it‚Äôs suddenly reduced to ¬£100, they also deducted ¬£75 for late payment??? I questioned this and then was told it‚Äôs a penalty for leaving British Gas and all customers who leave pay this, been with them over a year will never go with British gas again. Also unable to access account online as they‚Äôve never sorted that either after over a year of chasing that too, apparently as account was linked to another address in my email (previous address) it needed to be sorted by another department so never been able to look at bills or anything else for this address or my last one, would not recommend this company at all would totally avoid

Absolutely awful in every way. I never had a boiler check for nearly four years. Now as my renewal is up for grabs, trying to contact them is impossible. I went on to my account and was moved from the chatbot to a person, who then transferred me to another person, who then transferred me to another person who then transferred me to another, and finally, I was told I had to go on to WhatsApp and speak to them on there. I'm still waiting, not a word from them. Needless to say my renewal this year will not be with BG

The most disgraceful company I have had the misfortune to use.
The engineers are bodgers, or if faced with something they can't work out simply say "" buy a new boiler""
All they want to do is stick a probe on the flue and do one.
4 cancelled visits, I'm a home care customer have been for the last 8 years.
BUT NO MORE, I've had enough they have gradually got worse in last 2 years.
Miserable old men, who clearly are not happy in their job.
Rude and incompetent. DO NOT USE BRITISH GAS.
Go independent you will save yourself a lot of trouble trust me.
How this company continues to trade I do not know.
Criminal, still I have a boiler that's not working and still I'm foolishly paying ¬£30 a month.
Well not for long.

NEGATIVE STARS IF POSSIBLE. ABSURD, ABUSIVE COMPANY THAT DOES NOT VALUE ITS CUSTOMERS AND DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS.
I have been waiting four months now for a smart meter installation in order to pay my utilities online, like a normal human being living in the 21st century. The first appointment on 24 October was canceled without any notification. The second appointment attempt on 25 November was canceled an hour before they were due to arrive. Today was the third time unlucky - I received a text message yesterday AND emails confirming the appointment for 21 December between 1300-1700. I confirmed via text. Then I took a THIRD DAY OFF OF WORK to sit at home and wait for the engineer. Never showed.

Took me 15 minutes to get a human being (located in India) on the phone to tell me the appointment had been canceled and rebooked for MARCH. She booked me in for 27 January as if that was some sort of kindness. 

Additionally, I received a letter in response to my formal complaints of the canceled appointments and lost time off of work. The letter stated my response was due via email by 13 December. It arrived 13 December and I did not get home until after business hours as I was working late that week. I sent the email, but of course it's been over a week and no response by the agent. Unhelpful and an absolute insult.

Salt in the wounds - last week I returned home at 2130 from work and found the heating had gone out as the top up meter had expired. I was forced to drive several villages over at 2200 at night on icy roads to find a pay station that was still open. That was 40 minutes worth of diesel and exposing myself to dangerous driving conditions so I would have heat in my home during prolonged negative temperatures.

As soon as I can switch companies, I will be doing so.

Where do you start?  Took advantage of the offer to service the boiler and fire for ¬£37.  Paid.  Appointment booked between 12 and 6 - didn't turn up or let me know.
Checked on the website, had been changed sometime during the afternoon for 2 weeks later between 8 and 12.  45 minutes complaining about the no show and the time was not convenient, and was told it had been altered for that day to 12-6.
Day arrived, and found a note through the letter box in the morning and message on the answer machine to say Engineer had called at 8.00am but no one at home.  Second chap turned up at 3.15 from Scot Gas (I am in England), took the cover off the boiler and replaced it quickly saying he had to condemn it and would arrange for a rep to visit and give me a quote for a new boiler.  (Took less than 5 minutes), proceeded to service the gas fire, but needed the instructions as to how it worked!  10 minutes later left.  I insisted on leaving the boiler on and he wrote on the form that it was at my discretion.  
Got a second opinion from a qualified gas engineer - who said it didn't need to be switched off at all.
I have not received the ¬£66 for November (now 20th December), and spent from 
9.30 to 5.00 holding on for hours on Chat, then getting cut off, eventually spoke to someone, who said he would ring me and cut off.  Nothing!
Tried again and given an email to write to - it doesn't exist.  Found another Complaints site, to which I received a reply ""Thank you for your enquiry it may take 10 days to reply"". 
When I cool down a bit, I will try again to cancel an Annual Service and will not pay a cancellation charge, and will inform my MP that British Gas will not pay the Government Grant on time.

Same experience as all the other reviewers.  Vulnerable elderly mother with extensive physical and cognitive issues let down again and again.  Can't get through their awful phone system, after hours and hours of trying got through to someone at last.  I said thank goodness, please listen, I have an elderly and vulnerable person who is being put at risk by British Gas - I will go through what has happened so far and then I really hope you can help me.  I heard a click and an automated message said 'the other person has left the call'.  I assume she realised it would take a while and she wouldn't reach her 'getting rid of customer' target time.  I was cut off completely and had to start again.  This after listening to endless messages about how the BG staff must be treated with courtesy.  What about customers?  Had another experience a few weeks ago when an engineer didn't turn up after waiting 12 hours.  At last got through to BG and was told that the appointment was  7-10pm and that I was mistaken.  Offered to send emails, texts etc to the contrary (one sent only an hour earlier).  BG altered appointment and didn't tell me and then tried to tell me I was wrong!  i live 1.5 hour drive from my mum.  If the engineer had arrived at 10pm my mum would have been in bed. It would have terrified her having someone ring the bell in the middle of the night.  If she had tried to get to the door it would have been catastrophic.  What did the call centre person say - oh well you could have popped over when he arrived!  No bother leaving an elderly and vulnerable person in sub zero temperaturees with no hot water.  BG do not priritise vulnerable people, in fact they penalise them by making the phone system totally inaccessible.  Call centres obviously contracted abroad.  Staff can do ANYTHING without contacting their supervisor.  My experience shows that the worse it gets the less they want to deal with it.  BG homecare is a disgrace, and it is inevitable that there will be some very bad outcomes for people abandoned by them.

12:00- British Gas engineer came out for our annual service and stated our boiler was unsafe to use due to a leak in our flue pipe and sealant required around the boiler . The gas got capped off, boiler turned off and we was told by the engineer that an appointment would be arranged for an emergency engineer to come out and complete the repairs, where required, by 8PM. He did state that our service did not cover the cost for the repair and that we would have to pay separately amount (which we agreed)

17:54 - I called a member of the British Gas team on (0333 009 5784) to confirm that the engineer is definitely coming for 8PM and I was informed by the member of staff that an engineer was booked in for an emergency call out, for the repairs, and would be with us by 8PM and gave me a number just incase we needed any additional assistance or if the engineer is running late (03301000079)

20:23 - called a member of the British Gas team again on (03301000079) and was on hold for 1 hour & 12 minutes, then eventually got through to a member of the service team (21:35) where at the beginning of the call I asked if she had all of our details just incase the call / connection disconnected, in which case BG could call us back. The member of staff confirmed she had everything she needed and if we did loose connection she would call me back. Once that was confirmed I explained that our gas has been capped (so we are without heating & hot water) and the engineer that was arranged for 8pm still has not arrived. The customer service operator explained she would need to investigate and placed me on hold. After being on hold for around 5 minutes the line cut.

It‚Äôs now 22:31 the agent still has not called me back, I am on hold again (where I am told by the automated service that I still have another hour to wait. Still no engineer (due at 8pm) heating, hot water or gas! You have left us in an unfit state considering the engineer was here doing our annual service‚Ä¶. What have we paid the annual service amount  for! Go and tell us it not deemed safe, cap the gas (without heating and hot water) and not even attempt todo any repairs nor get in contact to arrange any advice or available appointments! I have a low immune system and high risk for health problems‚Ä¶ and dealing with the current temperatures and being left in this state is appalling, inconsiderate and careless.

23:17 - after being on hold for 1 hour & 45 minutes we have managed to get through to British Gas and they have just confirmed that 1st no engineer was arranged and that we should have never been informed (on one more occasion) that an engineer would be out with us at 8pm. The lady offered to place me on hold to see if there‚Äôs anyway we could get booked in for an emergency appointment tomorrow.‚Ä¶ after being cut off for the 2nd time this evening, this member of staff actually called me back (23:28) and confirmed I was cut off her end by mistake. I was then informed they are unable to assist and provide us with an engineer due to the high volume of demand they currently not taking any emergency appointments and that an engineer was never coming out to repair our boiler (even though this was confirmed on more than one occasion) 

WE HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH NO HEATING, HOT OR OFFER OF ASSISTANCE!!! ALL WE HAVE IS SIX LAYERS OF CLOTHING AND COLD WATER!!!! IF WE HAD KNOWN WE COULD HAVE GOT OUR OWN ENGINEER‚Ä¶ PAID ¬£84.03 FOR AN ANNUAL SERVICE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ACTIONED! JUST LEFT COLD, DIRTY AND HOPELESS‚Ä¶.

93 YEARS OLD, left with no heating for 9 days and still not fixed
My Aunt & Uncle who are 93 YEARS OF AGE, YES 93!!!! Have been totally abandoned, and left with no heating and hot water for 9 days now, an engineer eventually came out on Thursday to look at the boiler and said he would return Friday to fix it or Saturday at the very latest, hadn't turned up late Saturday afternoon so rang BG Homecare and they said yes he's booked in for the repair but wasn't answering his phone, called BG Homecare on Sunday was told he would definitely be there Monday, called 6.00pm Monday as he never turned up, was told don't worry, 100% he will arrive to repair the boiler that evening. HE NEVER TURNED UP. How Can BG Homecare think this is acceptable for 93 year olds to endure 9 days of sub zero temperatures with no heating, at their stage of life this isn't just an inconvenience it is LIFE THREATNING, signing up to BG Homecare they put their trust in you to take care of them and you betrayed that trust with false promises and false words of concern, Shame on you British Gas you are an absolute DISGRACE

Boiler broke, during a winter freeze, snow and minas 6 outside, no hot water, or heat, had to wait 5 days for somebody to come and repair fault, plumber arrived, and was told we needs parts ordering to fix fault. Will call again tomorrow, nobody came, looked online and the appointment was booked for a further 7 days on. Meaning we will have been without heat or hot water for 12 days. I pay for yearly service and repairs,and the boiler has recently been serviced and passed, correct me if I'm wrong but it states in their agreement pamphlet, that they can get parts the next day. Worst of it is you can not get to speak to a human. Its all automated service on phone. And when I finally did get in a queue to talk to someone I was in a queue tor 1hour and 46 minutes. So ended up putting the phone down. So still didn't get to talk to anyone. Hence we are sat at home  freezing. I will be cancelling my contract for repairs and finding a better more reliable service.

Disgraceful service from British gas today as we attempted to book an emergency repair for my 92-year-old father, who is disabled and housebound. His boiler broke down on Friday and as Home Care customers we attempted to arrange for a repair. We eventually succeeded in getting through and were able to book an engineer for the Saturday, though no-one ever appeared despite assurances that from further calls. I called on the Sunday morning to be told the booking had been cancelled (no reason offered) and not rearranged. On attempting to rearrange, I was told the earliest possible date was January 3, because regardless off my father's age and infirmity, he did not have a chronic health issue which meant the lack of heating posed a threat to life.  I should add that all four calls we made over the weekend entailed a wait of at least 45 minutes to speak to an operator, then on Sunday I was put on hold for a further 15 minutes after finally getting through. We got the boiler fixed privately and needless to say will be cancelling our Home Care contract. However, I found this exploitation of loyal and vulnerable customers to be shocking and deplorable.

Hi I had a new boiler fitted at the end off October 2022 which cost ¬£4700,  after two week I had to call them out as the new boiler would not turn off after 4 days a engineer came and fitted a new part to this new boiler but two week later the same thing went wrong with the new boiler, again it was over seven days before there came out and change the same part and all of this time we were told to turn the boiler off so no hot water and no heating and  since we had the new boiler fitted 3 of my radiators downstairs only get warn and it take over 3 hours for them to warn up,
I have ask then to sort it out and there have now told me I now need a power flush which I been told will cost about ¬£900 so I book them to do  a power flush on  friday the 15th December but have now found out there just coming out today to give me a quote.
 7 week ago we had a new boiler fitted and 3 week of them we were told to to keep the boiler off.
Would I recommend British Gas and I am sorry to say a big fat NO.
if any one is thing of going with British gas do not.
As for trying to contact them on the phone most of the time you waiting well over 30 min and once it was over 1 hour.

As of today still waiting for my boiler to be sorted out, I think I be looking at the new year before it will be sorted.

From taking money from us for our old house and our new house.
Now they have put us into debt even though we are ¬£279 in credit?
We haven‚Äôt had our money owed from the government either 
So stressful!
There is absolutely no way you can speak to anyone to sort it out as the just hang up on you

Transferred over from Peoples Energy who were fab!! Then dealt with British Gas a very broken company! Everything from start to finish from exceptionally poor customer service  to unprofessional advisors and managers ! Keep sending reminders for things that don‚Äôt need doing and have failed to set up my DD we are now on the 5th attempt to set this up as I don‚Äôt want to pay quarterly bills! I was on DD before and one of their advisor in their  wisdom decided to change it to quarterly and now am struggling to get DD set up again!! Made so many calls with no joys of any help or support, I work full time as a nurse and get promised a call back which never happens.

All I wanted to do was sort out a faulty Smart Meter!!!
You can even see on the image it has an error displayed with an exclamation mark and red triangle!

Ended up with BG after my supplier went bust, and can't change away from them as no one wants to accept new customers. They more than triple my direct debit every 6 months when they get an opportunity to 'review' it, even though my account is in credit at the end of each 6 months. Currently on live chat to them because they've violated the T&Cs of my direct debit by taking more than the agreed amount with no notice.

Everything. They overcharge, keep changing the Web site, don't pay the government support ¬£66 on time. Added fraudulent charges to our account, set DD way higher than necessary. Took them to the Ombudman, BG offered ""sincere apology"" only to continue behaving exactly the same way immediately afterwards.BG don't care so long as they can charge you and get away with it. Advise to anyone with them check your bills ,meter readings etc. There will be something they are trying to overcharge you with.

Had the misfortune of automatically being took over by British Gas when my previous supplier went into admin last year.
First few months expected bit of up down till familiar with my usage or they received my historic info.
12 months later they got no more clue than had at start despite my monthly readings....
One min need pay more...Next payin too much....added bonus of warning I will be in debit end of plan....then send me a balance I tried storing on account for winter back with no warning??? 
Only got accurate bill twice in a year.....and thank god I overpaid all their DD suggestions as I just about covered the last 6 month bill.....
The app and online account are about as much use as a chocolate fireguard regarding up to date usage...or anything remotely important. 
But I would say from my experience an easy way to build up debt if left 6 month at a time.
Tried at beginning asking if could get monthly statement so could monitor....nope. International Call centre answer was don't worry if you owe us we will tell you....in 6 months when next bill you( a fortune owing.)
That could mean a remortgage with the price of energy.
I have just switched supplier. Nobody could be as bad as this...
And never have I dealt with such  poor account information so leaves you pretty much praying your own usage/cost guess work is better.

After a failed appointment in October we expected the next one to be met but once again a no-show between 0800-1200. Call the contact number and sat for a long, long time in the queue and finally got an operator. I explained that the appointment was not kept and I was told I had the times wrong. This person said the appointment slot was 0800-1700 - not what my letter said! Anyway, at 1630 a technician arrived to do the smart meter installation and he also told us the appointment slot was 0800-1700! The smart meter work was completed and when I asked about the remote monitor and instructions for any adjustment to the meter I was told I needed to do that online. I was not even invited to see the meter which is outside our flat in a surface box. So, I have no idea how the smart meter works, who to contact with any problems, why I have no monitor fitted or what to expect from this unit. In my opinion Scottish Gas is an absolute shambles of bad organisation, failed communications - both written and by telephone, text or email.
I cannot believe this service standard is allowed to continue so assume your management and operational staff are completely inept!

Utterly abysmal; a disgusting lack of service.  My 90 year old mother has received her latest bill and needs to query the amount - apparently we have used far more this year than last year  (NO, we have not; if anything - have used less, considering the times we are living in and being 'extra careful!!).   Can we get hold of anyone?   After 4 hours, no.  At one point, 'homeservices' answered (after about 3 hours) - gave her a number to ring.  Since then, again, no answer.   We want someone to come and read our meter, not very strategically placed (!) in the garage.  She can't - she is disabled and unable to bend low down to read figures.  I can't - I've hurt my back and again, can't get down there.   We want a meter reader!  Website doesn't seem to cover this at all - and when I tried the 'webchat' - question wasn't recognised - and then it told us that 'our provider has ceased trading and we need to transfer to British Gas.'  We have NEVER been with any provider OTHER  than British Gas.  So - we cannot query the amount to pay; we cannot access a meter reader; we cannot ask anyone anything about anything.   What the hell is this like for vulnerable and/or very elderly people living alone, with nobody to support them or help?   It seems I am perforce to give one star for this 'service'  - please read that as zero.   Stinks!

So many phone calls to get something sorted, nice but untrained hopelessly ineffectual people answering the phone. They are clearly located in South Africa - does this explain why they cut you off so often?
Every time they put you on hold multiple times during the call to presumably ask advice from another person?? Very poor, each call takes ages.

Let me give you a brief history of my interactions with British Gas, regarding the EBSS vouchers that all British Gas customer were supposed to receive.
19th October 2022 I first contacted British Gas to find out when I would receive my first voucher of ¬£66. I was told I would get the voucher THAT WEEK. I didn't.
26th October 2022 I contacted British gas for the second time. I told them that a week ago I was told I would get the voucher that week, but I still hadn't received it. They told me that due to the royal mail strikes, they were delayed, but it will be with me in a few days.
4th November 2022 I contacted British gas for the 3rd time. I tell them that I still haven't received my OCTOBER voucher and its now November (all my other post was arriving on time so the Royal Mail strike had nothing to do with the voucher not arriving on time). This time they tell me that they'll send me the voucher to my email address. It will take a few days. Not sure why an email would take a few days but I just accept I'll have to wait even longer.
9th November 2022 I contact British Gas for the 4th time. I tell them I haven't received my voucher in my email like they promised. This advisor tells me that I won't receive an email, that the voucher will definitely be coming in the post (so the previous advisor just straight up lied when she said she'd sent them to my email address), and I would definitely get them in a few days. I really don't believe them at this point but I decided to wait a few more days.
16th November 2022 I contact British Gas for the 5th time. You guessed it, I still haven't received my voucher for OCTOBER. We're halfway through November now. This is getting ridiculous. This advisor tells me that the vouchers all had to be cancelled and reissued. Not sure how you cancel something which was supposedly posted 4 weeks ago, but once again I decide to wait ""a few days"" like this advisor suggested.
23rd November I receive a text apologising that the NOVEMBER voucher was late. I still haven't received my OCTOBER voucher. This makes me angry, so on
23rd November 2022 I contact British Gas for the 6th time. I tell them I'm not waiting anymore. I want my voucher to be sent to my email now, or I want to speak to a manager.
They tell me I will get BOTH VOUCHERS this month (November 2022) so to wait a few days. I've had enough now. I ask to speak to a manager.
Manager Vikram Singh tells me that they don't actually know when customers will receive the vouchers, and that every single time over the last 6 weeks that a British gas employee has told me I'll get the vouchers, it was a lie. They are lying to all their customers. They never sent the vouchers, and they have no intention of doing so anytime soon.
I've posted my ordeal online to see if I get a response, but British Gas don't seem to care.
So I'll be submitting complaints to the energy ombudsman services, and obviously leaving scathing reviews anywhere I can.

Simply the worst customer service I have encountered. British/Scottish gas migrated me to a new system without even the courtesy of informing me. My account was effectively cancelled without anyway of me knowing what I would be expected to pay. My direct debit was also cancelled. God knows how many of their customers have had the same thing happen to them and during an energy cost crisis at that. However I am aware that mistakes do happen and would have hoped that British/Scottish Gas would have been able to fix problems entirely of their own making in a prompt and efficient manner. I was wrong. I was so frustrated and angry that I e mailed Chris O‚ÄôShea the CEO of the parent company Centrica. I got an acknowledgement from that e mail telling me that they will email me again within the next 5 ‚Äì 7 working days to provide me with an update. That has not happened so it would appear that the contempt for customers goes right to the top. I think there needs to be a Twitter like clearance of the alleged British Gas Customer Service Management Team and the same for their IT Department Management. If there were not so many news stories out there at the moment I am sure the press would have a field day regarding this migration.

If I could give 0 stars I would! 
I spent 4 and a half hours on the phone to BG yesterday and my issues are still not resolved. 
A tenant moved out in august so i took over the energy until a new tenant moved in on 1st November. My electric account was in credit on my final bill ¬£112. I requested a refund but the cheque I received was only for ¬£46 I rang and queried to be told the ¬£66 left on the account was from the government grant and I could not have this money back eventually it was agreed a cheque would be sent but it hasn‚Äôt and since then my electric account and the credit balance no longer exists. BG has deleted any evidence of the ¬£66, my final bill and that an account ever exited! 
Then we come to the gas account which was a pre payment meter a final bill was issued showing I was in credit ¬£5 a day later a new final bill is issued stating I owe ¬£950 dating back to nov 2020 when the original tenant moved in so basically BG are trying to charge me for the previous tenants usage, I can‚Äôt even understand how there would be an outstanding bill when the meter was pre paid but if there is any debt does not belong to me! Customer services are useless passed around departments and fobbed off with lies!! AVOID at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

British Gas have changed their online system so that now..   when we are all trying our best to cope with rising fuel bills, customers can no longer see their energy usage or monthly costs and the smart meters, that were helping no longer work!. British Gas response to this is that is might be sorted out in 90 days! Never mind, they will continue to make millions in profit while they make our lives ever more difficult. This is gross incompetence and complete disregard for customers. And no doubt someone earned millions setting up the useless online platform we now have.

Been a Homecare customer for over 20 years. USED to be great but now atrocious. Last 2 times used them taken days to come out, rescheduled appointments and not fixed issues on the 1st attempt. Most recently, 4 engineer visits, blamed wiring as cause - done by them when installed Hive. Then blamed house wiring which we then had to have a cable run from 1 end of house to other, only then to find out it was neither but a boiler fault that needed parts. THEN after all this discovered that we were right and the boiler had been burning gas continuously for the previous 2 weeks despite being assured by these ""competent"" engineers it was not.
To then send a renewal notice with an increase of a few pence of ¬£120 per year on top of an already high price. Just cancelled and my renewal with a competitor with better trustpilot reviews is ¬£270 cheaper per year.

Customer service with this company is appalling. I have attempted to contact them on several occasions, eventually managing to speak to different people. My initial enquiry was to check I was not in credit as this is not practical for me currently and I do not want my money sitting with the company - only to be told I was in significant debit of varying amounts and then with no outstanding amounts whatsoever. Calls were not returned, information provided was poor, I was told I could not speak to a manager, the call was disconnected today (I was not rude and so no reason for this, I had purely asked to speak to a manager). My direct debit is apparently going to be increased from just over ¬£50 per month to ¬£848! I live alone, I am usually out at work, I do not leave any heating on when I am out, it is impossible to sort this out without a formal complaint and I plan to speak to the ombudsman. I would strongly advise to avoid this company in view of my experiences.

Have been contacting BG for several weeks as they unilaterally changed my tariff from an on/off peal tariff to their standard one.  This means no heating as my smart night storage heater recognises when tariff changes to night time, which is obviously not happening, so no heating from two months now.  Have been told many different stories by BG but no resolution.  Raised a complaint on 14th October, had confirmation email saying they would be in touch, to date nothing.  Phoned again this morning and, after 30 minutes on hold and asking to speak to someone in the complaints team, got cut off.

My pensioner aged parents ordered a new boiler from British Gas in July 2022 and were told that it would be installed in October. The boiler was delived a few days before the planned installation date, only for British Gas to cancel the appointment due to the engineer having COVID. Fair enough. The next appointment they gave them was 6 weeks later in November. 6 weeks a boiler was left in my parents kitchen. The boiler was meant to be installed Monday the 14th of November but today my parents received a call that they were cancelling this appointment as well because there was no engineer in the area. The next appointment they gave them was January 2023, six months after they ordered the boiler and when winter will be almost over. Do not order a boiler from British Gas.

Do not buy a boiler from this company.
I bought one in 2020, the salesman told me that the savings I would make would more than cover the cost of the boiler. At the time I had a contract with British Gas for service and repair of my boiler and central heating system, he told me that for the next 5 years I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay that as it was all part of the warranty that came with the boiler.  He also told me that the boiler would have to be serviced annually to maintain the warranty, he didn‚Äôt say that after the 1st year I would have to pay for the servicing at ¬£85 per visit. 
When I was reluctantly booking my service I also asked that the engineer to look at 1 of my radiators and my thermostat. I was told that the central heating was not covered after year 1.
I asked for this to be escalated to the person‚Äôs manager which she said she would, 1 day later I received an email from the person I had been taking to telling me that my complaint had been reviewed and rejected, because they said they had sent an email at the start of this debacle telling me of these facts. I told them I did not receive any emails from them. Again they were judge and jury and rejected my case.

I don‚Äôt know where to begin with the incompetence of this company. They lie and pass the buck all the time. They have caused me anxiety, palpitations and sleepless nights over my direct debits, my government entitlement, my smart meter ( not so smart), Homecare problems, South African call centres who lied and said they were working from home in Denmark! Dreadful customer services, told I would  be called back and no joy! I am writing to ombudsman tomorrow. The worst company out there - cowboys!

I have contacted British Gas again and again on multiple channels about my debt and how much I am struggling 
They're aware that I am working with Stepchange, have recieved a copy of my budget and been informed of the amount I can afford to pay (and how long this temporary measure will be in place). 
As a result they've bounced me between phone lines, text chat and IM chat. Claim I have not replied when I have screenshots of my attempts to make a payment plan. 
British Gas will not allow me to pay any lower than ¬£209 a month, not including electricity! How they can expect anyone to manage ¬£300+ on energy and still survive is beyond me. That will be all of my salary gone once rent is paid, not including council tax and water bills. 
Now on top of this I come home to scary letters that they're going to apply for a warrant to BREAK IN to my home, bill me for the locks and service fees and install a meter that I did not consent to and cannot even reach without a proper ladder. 
I've informed them of how stressful it will be to have a prepay meter, especially one that is over head height and how I cannot manage the stress of being without heat or electric when I run out of money. (which happens every month and I recieve no help or benefits) 
I can't believe the lack of empathy and now the forced entry when I have been begging for help and have let them know the prices I can manage for now.
Don't even bother to send me that copy and paste message to speak to someone on social media, everytime they put me back through to the debt phone line. 
- I want to cancel my account with you, switch to a more ethical and understanding company. 
- I want to create a REASONABLE payment plan for my final bill, where I can still afford to eat and pay my new provider. 
 - If these requests are not granted within 8 weeks I am contacting the energy ombudsman.

WARNING! Don't use British Gas EVER !! My elderly mother has had numerous engineers out, and her house flooded by British Gas. None of the engineers really seem to know what they are doing, which results in them sending another one out, and nobody is accountable or wants to take responsibility for the repair. She had her boiler (supplied by British Gas with numerous faults and call outs) replaced at her own expense, for another one which still isn't working properly. She was tricked into thinking that her central heating was covered for 5 years but it's only the actual boiler that's covered! When we tried to get the cover changed from British Gas to the boiler manufacturer, the manufacturer said they couldn't cover it until the guarantee had expired in 5 years time, so now she is stuck with the British Gas crappy cover. The only time British Gas made any effort was when they wanted to sell her the new one which they charged more for than the actual manufacturer. My Mum insisted on using this bunch of crooks because she thought British Gas could be trusted. But they have abused her trust and let her down big time. Please don't ever use them. If I could give zero stars I would.

Dreadful customer service. Rang 6 times in 2 weeks to chase energy support payment.  Each time was given different information, with one advisor actually telling me they have no control over when payments are made, it's the government! I waited on hold 47 mins then immediately got cut off. I received my energy payment 2 weeks and 3 days after I paid my dd! Shocking.  Doesn't matter now as I've switched suppliers today!

2 years ago I bought a new boiler from British Gas. Part of the selling point was the money we would save because we would not have to have the boiler  and central heating maintenance we were currently paying for, for the next 5 years. Now 2 years later we have a problem with one of our radiators called Brit gas to get an engineer and was told that it was only for year 1 that the central heating was covered. That is absolutely not what the salesman told us.
Absolutely disgraceful company who will promise you the earth just to get your business then deliver nothing

Please put nought rating so we can all use it scrap the other stars, they are not needed! Get rid of call centres abroad ..whilst call handlers are polite they only pacify..we are not children we don't need pacifying we want ACTION HONESTY and COMMITMENT to resolving issues , issues originating from British Gas themselves who happily take your money but drop you like a stone when you need help, and push you over to Foreign call centres who have no power to resolve cases. All of us then eventually have to join the Ombudsman queue to hopefully get restoration. We Should all petition to force British gas to answere our complaints on British soil in a timely manner through the courts.

Been with British Gas for many many years but I‚Äôve now had enough! Been waiting nearly 8 months for an upgrade to my smart meter. Nobody can tell me when I will get it so I‚Äôm unable to keep an eye on my energy usage. Also I paid my increased direct debit on 15th oct and as of today (27 th October) I‚Äôm still waiting for my energy support payment. After being on hold 27 mins, I was told to wait till 4 th nov and someone will email me to check its been paid! They take sometimes 3 weeks to respond to an email and sometimes not at all.

I‚Äôve had two years of my smart meter not working, I was told that three different things were wrong with it, had dates to fix it where engineers never turned up, bearing in mind I‚Äôm disabled and can‚Äôt reach the meter so had to get my Daughter to manually put the codes in for me. After getting the abundsman involved they are coming to fix it on the 9th!

Where do I start? At the time of writing this review, I have just sent a six page, A4 sized letter to Centrica, after sending it through email and not having it acknowledged by the case handler, who could not spell my name right or pronounce it correctly. I have been a customer for 12 years with BG and the last 4 years have been a complete nightmare, firstly I KNOW i have been overcharged, someone at BG or my Housing Association decided the tariff I would be placed on???? Then I have had issues with a direct debit and this was sorted out, then it re-occurred, BG were so bad in getting it sorted out the Bank has barred any further Direct Debit Mandates from British Gas. The customer service is terrible, the South Africans, blame the English Customer Service Advisors and then they tell you that things are not actioned because the BG executive does not listen to them, and that they are ignored, that is why the payment plan fails, the direct debits, go wrong and so on. Then there is the engineers, in one incident an engineer visited his attitude towards me in my own home was rude, abrupt, and unprofessional, I wanted to swing for him, no one would tolerate that in their own home. You complain, you are meant to receive a call back from. a manager, that never happens, the calls drop (terminate) the minute you start asking questions that there is no real answer to - especially when BG are at fault. If you can avoid BG with bargepole this is a company that was once great but that is myth and legend, now it is a mediocre company, that charges through the roof (before cost of living crisis) yet there is no transparency, so you really dont know what you are paying for.

Wow! British Gas are becoming such a joke,
Been with em for some years with our Boiler cover..weve got an old Back boiler system.....we were told by the Gas engineer that this was not much less efficient than a new one..due to low water pressure where I live..so stuck with it.
Had a problem over Covid period 20-21  Winter..No heating...they couldnt come out for two weeks....So much for emergency cover!.
So I cancelled.
Renewed the cover last year after my wife nagged about it (Had the repair done by an independant Gas safe)  all fine.
Their web site isnt working (hasnt been for a year), and when I finally booked a service over the phone..stress, stress, and they finally booked an appointment..Guy turned up and walked away..cant do the service..I wasnt told it was a Baxi LOL. ""Someone will contact you"".....after ringing AGAIN  because they didnt contact me....""some one will contact you""...well that was 2 weeks ago..so phoned today....cant do it until 6th December....funny thats after they take another years renewal......as it should have been done before November.
If you can avoid British Gas I can only recommend you do so.....I will wait until they have serviced the boiler...then cancel the direct debit and get an independent.......What a joke all these big organisations have become.

BG doess not have an email address for questions or complaints, they do but only to reply and say that they cannot identify your email address and you have contact them by phone Monday to Friday between 9-5 which is impossible for people working during those hours or on the chat where is always says ‚Äú the teams are busy at the moment‚Äù or you can write them a letter.
Why does BG not have a complaints email address? They only have a postal address. It takes longer and cost more to send a letter for the customers and company as well, although I believe the company expenses are paid by the customers as well. This must be a very expensive service to run. Also, the letters can get lost. Would not using an email address be more effective, less costly and better controlled by the company as the emails should be automatically recorded?

What a travesty and pale ghost  of the formerly excellent British Gas company of yore is this current ‚ÄòBritish Gas‚Äô. Their most appalling telephone system sends you round multiple selections, none of which are the ones you want, with no option to get to a human unless you redial and try a different option. The voice option is equally limited in what it can accept eg ‚Äòjust say what you need, eg ‚Äòmeter reading‚Äô. Me ‚Äòno power‚Äô . It then repeats it. I try with ‚Äò emergency‚Äô. It just doesn‚Äôt understand that I had no power at all, on a cold day, and yet we were classed as a vulnerable household with tiny children and my daughter in a wheelchair. I first rang to take over a property. However the on line app never worked, and never recognised me despite repeated calls, my prepayment card (sent with the wrong first name and gender) never worked, and the change promised from pre payment meter to account never took place as promised, though my credit rating was good.  The operators seems badly trained and clueless. You spend hours on the phone each time fruitlessly trying to get help. Even when I rang British Gas to fit a new boiler, they never rang back as promised, so (fortunately as it turned out) I went elsewhere. Then after each stressful phone call you get a survey of 4 short replies - but actually only 2 come - and as they never seem to take any notice of them I don‚Äôt know why they bother. A completely clueless company that is best avoided.

If I could, I would give a 0 to this company. They are fu*cking sh*it and a big joke. I wasted 3 hours on the phone today because my bill hasnt arrived yet. I called in May so they can change incorrect details because I was shown as pay as you go customer which I never was! They never changed it so I had to waste my time again today. I spoke with 3 people at first, I was told new bill will arrive within 3-5 working days. I checked my app and they added 2000kwh to my usage, from nowhere. I called again the lady on the phone asked questions about meter serial number, meter readings and then told me she cant access my usage but bill will arrive within 7-14 working days. Fu**cking unbelievable! Everyone is saying different information. When I asked why and where they got that number from and if I can speak with team leader, she didnt mute herself and I could hear team leader saying to drop the call with me and hung up on me. Can you believe it? Such a big company an has to use poor and useless customer service in India to save money. I honestly have enough dealing witg you every month but unfortunately no one is taking new customers!!!!! You are waste of time and money. If anyone competent from british gas reads, please make changes because your company is useless

Avoid British Gas business. Charged me over ¬£100 a month for three months for a shop that was shut. Increased the money owed by nearly ¬£100 by claiming that that this was what the meter showed when they had confirmed a meter reading a week before which showed a credit to the account !

Homecare Rubbish
Woke up on the 19/09/2022-boiler screen blank, no hot water no heating.
Tried to book an appointment on line earliest 21/09/2022 between 8 and 12am
Phoned to say that is ridiculous basically got told ""take it or leave it"".
21/09/2022- waiting for the engineer. Get a call at 10:00 am saying the engineer can't make it. I complain they say ok the engineer will be there by 1:00pm. I now have to book a days leave. I write a review on Trustpilot, there is a response that it is sorted with links to facebook &twitter (neither of which I have). Come 4:00 p.m still no engineer so I phone. Sorry but the engineer is not coming but we'll book you in for tommorrow between 8 and 12.
22/09/2022- I decide to go into work as I can't take another days leave waiting. I get a text at 10:00 am to say the engineer is on schedule. 12:30 p.m I get a phone call to say the engineer is running late but can they make it in the afternoon (between 1 & 6 p.m). So I am still waiting now 125 hours without hot water or heating. It is all lies from the television adverts to the booked appointments. AVOID AVOID AVOID. I shouldn't really be writing this review as a bad review seems to prejudice you but hey ho it can't get any worse or can it............

Really disappointed in your service, always thought you were one of the good guys. Two weeks ago you advised there had been an error your end  and that my bill would be looked into, a discount would be applied and debits would be frozen until such a time as you had investigated further and discussed the outcome. You even went as far as to schedule a call. I came away from this experience feeling lucky to have such a caring provider. Two weeks later you‚Äôve pushed an ¬£800 monthly debit through for a one bedroom flat. To cap it off you have no notes on your system, I was hung up on once, your average waiting time is twenty minutes and when you do get through your call centres are unable to offer any meaningful assurance a fair resolutions will be reached. Anyone got any suggestions of better energy providers?

After waiting in all day for a #BritishGas engineer as I have #homecare cover, 2 no-show appointments later, (booked yesterday morning Friday and today, Saturday) we're still sitting in the freezing cold and now have to wait until tomorrow again, Sunday, despite explaining that I have vulnerable individuals here!

The first engineer claimed he was here, however he did not knock as requested. I stood by the front window waiting for ages, went to the toilet for 30 seconds in which time he claimed he'd been and gone.

15.47 - I rang bg to ask them to please rearrange for someone to come today, the woman I spoke to assured me someone would come by 6pm today, I said ok, however no one showed up.


18.05 - I rang again to ask what time I can expect the second engineer. However, the person stated there had been no further appointments scheduled today, so the woman had lied to me. Finally, this last out of hours customer service rep (Dennis) was so rude, cold and uncaring when I requested that a manager please call me back and that I had to go (I had been kept on that call for almost one hour), screaming aggressively and hoggishly at me when all I simply stated was that I had understood he could not guarantee a call back, but that I was unable to wait again and had to go.

Not only was I let down by the the first engineer who could not be bothered to do the job, the second woman who promised someone would come today, the third rude customer service rep. Now we have to wait in the cold again for another day tomorrow... So much for caring about the vulnerable.

I am disgusted, as this is not the first time bg have let me down in the past month and a half, I have also advised my friends and family to avoid british gas at all costs if they wish to stay warm this winter.

I would like this to be fully investigated, to be recompensed for the shoddy service received/in this case, 'not received' on more than one occasion. It seems paying for homecare cover these past 20 plus years will have been absolutely futile.

I am entitled to refund on my account and so far it has taken 3 weeks, 7 calls and 9 hours on the phone to get to the point of still not having my refund raised. I keep being told that the refund has been processed and that it will be with me within 3-5 days. Day 6 I am ringing to say its not there, to then be told it has been processed but needs a manager to sign it off. It will be done within 24 hours. Three days later, still no manager sign off. I insist on talking to the manager but I can't as they are in a meeting. They manager will process the refund and email me to confirm within 24 hours. Still no email of confirmation three days later. I ring twice to speak to a manager but they are in meetings on both occasions. Then I decide enough is enough and I wish to raise a complaint. I am told a manager will ring to go through the complaint. I admit, I miss the first call but the inaudible voicemail is useless. I ring the complaints team to be told someone will ring by 1630. At 1640 I am ringing again, this time I am told nobody will speak to me today as they close at 1700 so will need to wait another day. I am still nowhere near getting my refund which in the current climate we all need every penny we can.

Who would have thought generating a bill based on a meter reading, nd then getting the address for that meter correct would be difficult?  British gas seem to think so.

They were the supplier for our new build house 4 years ago, and we'd left them before they could bill correctly.  Unfortunately we're now back with them as our recent supplier went bankrupt.  British gas once again are billing a ficticious address for our supply based on plot number, but in a different town.  In addition, they won't accept the final reading given by our previous supplier, nor the readings I've supplied.  They have a made up value and are estimating readings from that.

I'm now threatened with debt collectors to pay their 'imaginery bill' based on made up readings.   They have no interest in the actuals, and despite their senior complaints team looking into the mess they've created, they still 'insist' I should pay.   

Overall an incompetent supplier best avoided.

Shocking service from British Gas. Ordered eight new radiators three months ago. These should have been delivered yesterday and installed today. Radiators never showed up. Was told today that the company who supply them has gone out of business. Nobody at British Gas seems to have a clue what‚Äôs going on. Have cancelled the order and will employ a more reliable company to carry out the work. Avoid British Gas for this kind of work.

British gas are absolutely to be avoided! They are crooks. They lie, they cheat , they steal. I live in a tiny one bedroom apartment. I use about 13 units of gas a month,  this would come to about ¬£40 a month - give or take. Well not to British gas who billed me ¬£1800 for two months use of gas and ¬£280 for electricity on the very same day! Stating that I'd used over 1000 units of gas. Look if I owned a seven bedroom property,  it still wouldn't reach that copious amount. I'd like to say that it was an isolated case but no, I am met regularly with absolutely absurd bills ranging from ¬£720 to ¬£900 for one months use! Oh and they just take it from your bank account without telling you. You will of corse be on the phone for three hours with them being passed around an Egyptian call centre only to be lied to that the problem is solved, be told to contact your bank to get a refund, so I do and then four days later British gas pounce again and take back the money that they told you to recover, and around and around this goes. Do yourself a favour and just boycot them at all costs. Within two years of being with them I have been charged over ¬£3000 with British gas getting debt recovery involved for a bill I didn't even run up. Absolute con artists.

Two major complaints 
1. First complaint 
British gas fixed an appointment to fix my smart meter on 30/08/22 between 8am to 12noon, did not turn up. Later called that engineer will turn up before 4pm that day. I sat in my house all day till 9pm and nobody turned up and no apologies from British gas for my day wasted.
I called British gas two days later and another staff fixed another appointment for today 06/09/22 between 1pm to 5pm. I having been waiting and is 5.40pm and no phone call or text or engineer. That two days of my valuable time wasted by British gas. I have call all numbers British gas to check if they will still attend, not making any head way with the automated machine responses after being on phone for over 30 minutes.  This is totally unacceptable for a great company as British gas. The worse part of my call is that the machine still hasn't that my smart meter booking is 30/08/22; the booking for 06/09/22, seem not have been updated in British gas system and nobody to speak to. I feel really disappointed. Hence, all promises made by staff when they rebooted the appointment and sent me a text message for appointment for 6th September was ticking of box. It is disgusting. I have never had this sort of experience from aby company or British gas before. If someone told me this experience, I will not believe it will happen in Great Britain. 
2. My second complaint, I cannot put here.

The call centre agent was rude and aggressive towards her and didn't care when she tried to explain her situation he didn't care.

I moved house and asked to be moved to BG for my electrical supply as well as they were already supplying the property.  I asked for key meters and was told this would be OK.
Chats, phone calls and letters later, they kept changing the details of my account and sending letters with conflicting information.
Last straw, they have now changed my supply address so it looks like I will be paying a bill for a local solicitors office.  Its the system, it's not fit for purpose.  Different people dealing with different aspects of the supply and you have to speak to somebody else all the time.  All very pleasant on the phone but if electricity advisers can't talk about gas what chance does anybody have of getting things sorted out.

Moved into a new property in April, had no choice but to register with British gas. Asked to have a top up meter installed, they asked for meter readings first which I supplied them with. I was then told that they don't match their database so I should expect a call back. Never had a call back so I called up, explained what had happened and went through this whole process dozens of times over the course of 4 months. Now they are trying to charge me over ¬£500 and the meter readings are still wrong!! Called up today, finally getting a top up meter but not until the end of September because that is the earliest they can get an engineer out to fix both gas and electric meters! Once the bill is paid off, I will be going to a different supplier!

The worst company that I have ever dealt with. Staff and management are totally inept at dealing with the issue I have had to phone up for 8 times now! Gas meter was faulty, the electric meter was faulty, then engineer didn‚Äôt show up after waiting 5 hours. Three times British Gas promised a call back, all three times the call never materialised. 
After billing my account up to date and switching suppliers they ‚Äúrefunded‚Äù me the outstanding credit on my account. Or at least this is what they said. 5 days later no money, after phoning for an 9th time they confirmed the refund had been processed but that it would take up to 10 days. After 10 days still no money, I then receive a bill for ¬£1900, even though my final bill was sorted and the refund of credit on to my account processed, and on the 10th phone call the operator informed me that they had never sent me a refund and that I was now in debt over ¬£500. 
An absolute shambles of a company that is charging the earth and racking in huge profits.

Asked BG to send an engineer to check if so-called meter tails, the cables joining a smart meter and a fuse box, are safe to use because they are old and we are not renovating the property. Took more than hour and several advisors just to send a query. The result? A rude and unprofessional engineer arrived to the site to exchange my elec and gas (!!!!) meters because they are faulty (????). Not even looking at the cables, the engineer simply lied to both me and his manager that they are safe. BG offered me to book a commercial, charged for appointment, because they can't confirm that the meter tails that they said are safe are safe indeed. Yes, it all sounds ridiculous, and so does BG.  The worst thing is that I can't find a decent company to do the job, because the cables between a meter and a fuse box are considered to be an energy supplier property and the works aren't contestable.

Will false you to switch to their ""Smart meter"" under false pretenses. Basically saying the old key meters are a fire risk and if you dont change them now they will take legal action. The real reason they want you to change is so they can make it ALOT easier to rob you with the new energy prices (all done automatically with the smart meter) The best part of it is the so called smart meter they installed, the smart screen you get with it and the internet app NEVER seem to work, top up or in sync with each other AT ALL. Not to mention the phone calls you will get at 12am to say your top up will be credited within 24hrs (never does) Oh and when you call them about it they will threaten you with a ¬£25 call out charge if they find nothing wrong basically putting you in the mercy of a strangers competence.

Currently in a huge dispute with British Gas. They have cancelled and replaced my bills multitudes of times (seven times just in June?).  Each time they replace the bill they prevent you from seeing the previous one so you can't see what changes have been made.  I, however, have downloaded each bill and pulled up one from 4th July which showed from 4th Oct-4th July I was in debt by ¬£437.62.  I cancelled my DD after a phone call with a rep who said I had to increase my DD payment threefold and I had no choice!!?  I am now making one of payments each month of what I can afford. 
 After I took this action my bill was cancelled and replaced to show a new bill for exactly the SAME period now saying I owed ¬£870.85!!??  I have looked closely at both bills and can see how this was achieved.  They changed the first meter reading for both gas and electric on 4th October making it much lower (how can that change - they took the reading?) so that meant that my usage over the same period was so much more!!  I have written a letter of complaint to BG and am waiting to question someone over this.  I am very suspicious of what the hell is going on here!

British Gas App is next to useless.
Ever since I switched to British Gas three years ago and I have a dual fuel account the App says it‚Äôs not receiving data from my gas account but the electricity account is receiving data.
The App is not showing meter readings., However, I‚Äôm being billed half yearly for gas and electricity consumed.
I have to calculate my usage by taking my own readings and using my last bill as a reference.
The App needs fixing.

I have been in dispute with British Gas virtually non stop since they took over my Gas and Electric when my previous supplier went bust last year. I have tried to use Resolver to get British Gas to rectify things, but they have stopped responding to my Resolver Case. Most of the problems have been over grossly exaggerated Direct Debits. I have lived in the same house for over 20 years with very consistent usage! Most recent problems are that British Gas have deleted and replaced the bills that were generated since they took over my accounts. Previous to doing this, my Gas account was considerably in credit and on course to reach zero by the end of the account year. - Overnight, when the bills were replaced, my Gas account went into significant debt and I cannot access the deleted bills. British Gas now deny receiving a Credit of ¬£147.68 from my previous supplier, despite that I have an email from British Gas stating that they had this credit! This would have shown on the deleted bills, which of course I cannot access. The deletion of this credit would also explain why my Gas account went from being considerably in credit, to considerable debt overnight! I have sent British Gas a copy of their own email confirming receipt of my credit from my previous supplier, and they haven't had the common courtesy or manners to acknowledge my email. - I am tearing my hair out with them, and to say that I am angry is an understatement. I would give British Gas zero stars if it were an option!

Oh my word, where do I start? All was fine before my previous energy company went bust and we were automatically moved to British Gas meter readings were given all seemed ok, until I got the bill in Jan 2022 which showed I was using ¬£421 per month of energy(¬£320 of this electricity alone), 26 chats, 3 calls and a meltdown when the call lady said ""well it is winter""  yes my love it is winter but for ¬£320 per month I could grow enough Cannabis to afford the bill! 

Finally I spoke to a lovely lady who said this seemed excessive and that someone would come out to test my meter, the day arrived and engineer was doubtful it would be a meter issue and that maybe I should get electrician out, yes yes mate test the meter.  What do you know meter faulty shiny smart meters installed bill adjusted to reflect outrageous issues start reading zero, I assumed this would be it.

Day after engineer left house smart meter box lost connection, informed them via chat with the ""have you turned it off and on"" script.  Also no bills just an exceptionally high electricity usage on the app( approx ¬£320!!) finally a bill Jul 22 with an estimated reading from Mar-Apr and a ¬£795 debit brought over.

Full melt down 2 in progress cant get through on chat and attempted 7 calls where I was 143 in the line.  Finally got through to an agent who has reversed my bill and said someone will be in touch......

I almost give up, I have no idea what I should/could be paying and with rising prices based on my alleged current use will be about 6K a year 5k on electricty.

No we do not live in a Mansion nor do we grow Cannabis, no hot tub and recently had a full electrical check.

In mid-2021 I signed up for a boiler repair & HomeCare package.

The British Gas engineer deemed the boiler to be in working order, but it wasn't, so I had it replaced via a different company. I called up to cancel my HomeCare subscription immediately and was assured it was cancelled. Fast forward over a year and I find out I have been charged all this time for HomeCare and was only given a 3-month credit. THIEVES

App and website still not working to check how much you have on your meters over a year later. Clearly not bothered to fix them.

When I got pleurisy due to them cutting out my gas because my Smart Meter screen and app were showing that I had ¬£15 on my gas when in fact I had nothing (So their fault) they said that someone will come the next day or two to turn my gas back on (I couldn't do it myself due to disabling health problems... With pleurisy on top of that). I had to scream cry over the phone to get them to turn my gas on the same day (It's been hours of pain in the middle of winter without heating. And I was on their priority services register due to disability. They don't care).

Now they were supposed to, a week ago, refund me ¬£100 for what I had on my gas and electricity before moving house, and they were supposed to change my meters to my new place, plus delete my old address account. They didn't delete my old address account until I called them to ask why they haven't done that. They didn't refund me. And they put my neighbour's meters as my meters. And on top of that they told me that they'll call me back the same day, but three days later and they still haven't called me back. Huh... Seems to be a clear sign... Ableist much? No care towards disabled people. And clearly no care towards elderly people from the reviews that I read either (I don't have experience on the elderly side, I believe them though).

My gas is ok but the electricity they has cocked up and not changed it over. I have been calling them daily speaking to seven different people and no one has fixed it yet. And even though they know it's there fault they have today sent a letter saying a debt collection company is going to call at my home and they will charge me ¬£39 for this. I have lodged complaint after complaint. How can i resolve and pay through my meter if they can't do the easiest thing - switch my account across.

Its a known fault, why didn't someone say on the phone to check; it would have taken 2 seconds, rather than waste my time, the technicians etc. To exercurbate it further, to try and complain is painful in the extreme. The complaints email and even the CEO's are apparently full and returned, unread! I finally get a reply and it was totally unacceptable.

Absolutely terrible service from the stone ages!!!! Their smart meter doesn't work but they won't replace it and openly admit there are no engineers in the area for months to come and have a look at it. As a result they are guessing our energy bill. Because we technically have a smart meter we aren't allowed to submit our own readings for better accuracy unless I sit on hold for 45 minutes during my working day because they don't take calls outside of Mon-Fri 9-5! I can not believe that during this period of increasing energy costs that a supplier is not taking ANY ACTION to help support customers. LITERALLY all it would require is the option to submit a meter reading online if your smart meter is not submitting readings. Even raising a complaint is difficult as you equally have to wait on hold or write a letter - no email address offered as a simple solution to raise concerns or get a quick response!!

I recently had my boiler serviced via my British Gas / Scottish Gas z home care The boiler was serviced in May 2022 and to date I am still awaiting the service report . I contacted B G via their app 3 times and all I got was they have no details about service because it was done by sub contractor Local Heroes and they could not contact them . The service engineer came from Yorkshire  . They gave me a job number and web address for me to get report . But web site was a nonsense as I could not put in job number . Firstly I pay a lot of money upfront for this agreement so why should I chase up the service report . How can BG arrange a service but yet cannot contact the sub contractor . So frustrated with the level of commitment to a customer .  Final straw I spoke to someone in customer service 2 weeks ago who promised me a paper copy of service report but this morning I received a letter dated 3rd July 2022 saying I should get in touch with Local Heroes for report . I am surprised at this state of affairs By the way letter states service was okay but yet they could not supply a detail report . I wonder how could they make that assessment when they insist they cannot supply a detailed report . Weird way to run a company .If they are not great at coordinating this simple thing I wonder if I needed anything done Under  the home service will I be able to depend on them .

I wouldn't even give 1 star! Switched to BG as supplier of last resort and have spent the last 8 months trying to get them to send us a bill. Advised by letter all in hand and no reading needed. Provided readings via live chat and on phone but not recorded. Took months to get set up then they just didn't take the DD and the meter reading reminder stopped. After 3 complaints, this was 'resolved'. Then they recalculated the entire billing from inception and told me we're in huge debit. Another complaint resulted in another recalculation leaving us in credit. Just had another bill that has back calculated again and now even more in debt!! 5th complaint just submitted. Every person I speak to tells me it's sorted and then 2 weeks later, they screw it up again. USELESS!!

Inept.

BG have yet again messed up our Direct Debit, Readings and Bill. 
Over the last 4 days our account has shown 2 bills and 2 reversals of over ¬£1k each. We've been in debit for over 1.5k, in credit for ¬£55 and now in debit for ¬£800!!! I sent our readings and they said they were wrong so they wouldn't use them to bill me so I sent photos of the meters. This is when the money merry-go-round began on the App. When I looked at our usage on the App for the last quarter it is sky high. The only way it could be this high is if a music festival was being run off our meter. Utterly ridiculous! Then I find out they've been taking ¬£50 a month more than the agreed direct debit without informing me of the change. This is the 2nd time in 2 years they've made a huge blunder and I've wasted time trying to get hold of them with absolutely no luck. It's wearing and infuriating.

Billing Fraud. Every month bill is getting cancelled and replaced. Fortunately I have saved all the bills in my laptop. When I compared last month bill with present month bill. They are adding few kWh to months which we have already paid for and this is happening without our knowledge. 

This is my bill example:
5th May Bill Statement : 
21 Oct 2021 - 25 Nov 2021 559kWh at 19.695p per kWh ¬£110.10

25th May Bill Statement : 
21 Oct 2021 - 25 Nov 2021 593kWh at 19.695p per kWh ¬£116.79

How could 2021 meter reading will change in 2022 May month billing?

Other utility companies have really useful apps to help you understand your usage and spending. The British Gas App is a waste of time, it only shows your history of bills there is no current data displayed. And it is so slow. They need to look at their competitors and offer a better app for their customers. The British Gas app has been designed for themselves i.e. if you wish to purchase extra British Gas services and not for the benefit of their customers. Complete waste of time.

I have been a British Gas customer for years and pay for boiler maintenance on a direct debit. In April I decided to have all my radiators replaced. The work was entirely satisfactory.  When I received the bill I paid the full amount immediately by cheque. I received a letter saying money received. I also had verbal confirmation that money has been received.  However, I keep getting bombarded with threatening letters saying I have not paid and the latest one says the bailiffs are calling on me in 7 days time. My bank confirm BG have received the funds. No one at BG can solve the issue and I fear a CCJ may be lodged against me even though I have paid. So, do not deal with British Gas, as although their engineers seem good, their backroom systems are inefficient.

British gas were appalling during my customer time with them May 2021 to May 2022. They messed me around constantly, customer service was shocking especially a Becky in customer relations. I ended up having a final payment of over 200 pounds despite being consistent with meter readings and asking them repeatedly to up my direct debit to cover. Multiple hours spent on hold with them, hours of wasted time with no resolutions and a customer service assistant Aidan Abraham's who lied to me saying I owed nothing then a final bill came through a week later. I just felt so let down and will never ever go with them again, thieving nasty company that are only concerned with money not customers.

Been unable to log into my British Gas account for the past couple of weeks now, estimates for a new fixed account you sent me are well under estimated I know this because I keep a regular check on what I used, so I know that if I signed up for this new deal I‚Äôd end up paying a lot more that you quoted me. One of the worst companies I‚Äôve ever delt with, as soon as the markets open up I‚Äôm off.

Worst energy company ever. Have only been with them 8 months after my last supplier went bust. In these 8 months I have had 6 bill reversals all to be replaced with bills in their favour, even though my meter readings have always been up to date, they never give an explanation as to why. For such a big company they seem to get the bills wrong an awful lot. If I could give 0 stars I would

One star is too many! Verbal dispute over bills. I maintain daily spreadsheet so know exactly how much I‚Äôve spent. This last month, not for the first time, their bill doesn‚Äôt equate to my expectations. I call and discuss, yes there‚Äôs a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô and they‚Äôll amend it. Even that, they f...
up. And double my expectations.
To compound their incompetence they now send me a breakdown of usage of gas and electric and money they‚Äôve received on my behalf BUT what they conveniently forget to include is the credit balance of over ¬£200 they received from my previous supplier. 
I see a very long day ahead trying to reason with these goons.

Will be contacting the Ombudsman

I agreed to pay British Gas ¬£20 a month for a vacant flat I owned November 2018 Used no gas or electricity
Paid ¬£20 a month for 10 months..11th month get a bill for ¬£56..so I cancelled direct debit paid over ¬£300 although used no Gas no Electric as both off. 
Flat got let September 2020
I was receiving letters asking for money 
from British Gas asking me to pay money owed from November 2018 to March 2021

I spoke to someone at British Gas and explained no Gas could of been used and no electric..plus period they stated it was let out?
My letting agent sent letting agreement 
to verify 

Women at British Gas said they would write off the ¬£400 plus for the electricity??
There had been none used by me

They appeared to be picking numbers out of the air 

Have since had 4 separate debt collection agencies harassing me 
3 have gone the last one because o reported them to the Ombudsman for texting and leaving voicemails on my Ex partners phone??  How they got his number I don't have a clue..we separated in 2012..10 years ago 

It's since happened again by a debt collection agency called Pastdue
They text my ex partner who forwarded it to me..they actually did not have my number??
I've explained everything to them and they want to letting agreement which British Gas already have. 

I've taken legal advice as I've never personally had an account with British Gas only found a letter from previous occupant who had vacated a year before I purchased the flat with no water supply at Auction.

Since then I've had a letter from British Gas asking me to pay an electricity bill? Saying they've contacted me several times completely untrue 
The debt collection agencies were after Gas money 

My legal advisor is telling me that British Gas has breached the Data Protection Act by informing my ex partner of 10 years ago that I owe money.. I was mortified when I found out 

I don't owe any money..infact I've paid them ¬£300 for an empty flat
With no Gas or electricity used 

British Gas have always had a bad reputation estimating bills

I will be taking this further..I've been continuously harassed..my tenant has been receiving letters..my previous address has been receiving letters relating to myself 
I will be seeking compensation for the distress caused having to be informed by my ex partner who I've not seen since 2012 that he was concerned I was in debt and felt it necessary to contact members of my family 
I'm so angry at British Gas they have broken the law 
They are not getting away with this

I have had my boiler service today & the engineer was polite, curtious and completed the service in a professional manner.

Paid for system flush, when boiler broke down the independent engineer informed me that I "" should have had my system flushed, as this would have prolongede life of boiler"".

Atrocious company. British Gas were my supplier of last resort when MoneyPlus energy folded in 2021 and from day 1 they have been an absolute nightmare to deal with. Not only is their customer service virtually non-existent, they tacitly ignore formal complaints in the hope that you just go-away. My direct debit increased from ¬£80 a month to over ¬£240 and I complained to them that I would not be able to pay such an astronomical increase.

This company is effectively gouging as much as it can from the millions of extra customers they have inherited from the failure of other firms. My attempts to resolve this via communication were ignored. I waited 28 days for a response before it became obvious that they were never going to respond.

The ¬£240 was taken from my account a few days ago and I made the decision to immediately cancel my direct debit and find another provider. Disgraceful behaviour on behalf of British Gas and were I in the market to move suppliers, I'd avoid these gouging, horrible shills at all costs.

Do not use british gas unless you have literally no other options. The most horrendously incompetent company I have ever encountered, which is saying something. It took 6 hours and 4 attempts to set up my account, even though my situation couldn'ty be simpler - one person renting a flat for one year who has a meter.  Nearly every bill they send is wrong even when they have been given the accurate meter readings just before. And now, for no identifiable reason, they have moved my account to another server, meaning I cannot access it. I cannot access the account, close the account, provide meter readings or pay any bills. But it'll be me who has to suffer when they finally get their incompetent selves together and start chasing me for money I don't owe.

Annual boiler service which should have been a formality as it has been in previous years, turned into a nightmare. Booked boiler service on a Thursday but engineer did not turn up until Friday. Engineer carried out a ""service"" & decided to disconnect the hot water due holes being found in the combustion box. Left my tenants without hot water for 4 days. I had to re-book a second engineer visit today & spoke with the same engineer who claimed that current bolier needed to be replaced with a new one as parts were no longer available. However further discussion revealed that parts for the boiler can be found online but British Gas don't want to do this & they want you to spend money with them on a new boiler. british gas engineer snuck in the fact that british gas offer interest free deals on new boilers (you see where this going right). Suffice to say I won't take british gas on their ""offer"" & will get a 2nd opinion on the current boiler. if it does need to be replaced then it won't be with british gas.

I had to take a day of work to allow a engineer to fit a smart meter which put me at a ¬£90 loss. The engineer did not arrive and was told I would receive ¬£30 compensation. I never received the ¬£30 for 12 working days which entitles me to a extra ¬£30 for non payment. British gas then payed themselves ¬£30 on my behalf leaving me still ¬£90 out of pocket. When I raised a complaint was spoken to like a idiot for 3 days on whatsapp then when I finally rang to end it all.

My account was moved to British Gas when my previous supplier stopped trading.  During the past 8 months they have issued 5 bills of which 3 were cancelled after payment, i which forgot to charge for electricity and 1 which used the wrong meter readings.  Since increasing tariff at start of May they still haven't updated my smart meter to the new charges.  This means my in house monitor is displaying garbage.  Totally inept company, customer services are impossible to contact, how they are allowed to operate I'll never know.  Shall vote with my feet and take my custom elsewhere.

- I haven‚Äôt received a bill for almost a year and now I‚Äôm told I owe money 
- My tariff has changed and they didn‚Äôt let me know 
- Without agreement or notification, they increased my monthly direct debit from ¬£125 to ¬£270 which sent me overdrawn 
- Everything and every message pushes you towards the BG app, but it still doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt show your data 
- I have been in credit for months, but they won‚Äôt return my money 
- Apparently you can get an EV rate for electric car charging, but then it doubles your normal day rate 
- After several calls I have no idea what‚Äôs going on apart from my bills have increased by more than 100% 
- My boiler is overdue a service even though they have doubled my service package price 

Honestly the list goes on and I have proof of the list above

While trying to sort was 188 in queue for live chat. However would say that I then contacted them through Facebook messenger and had a very swift response from Damian who resolved my problem and sent details to customer services who also contacted me so my issue was not with this part of the service just the fact that I have to keep contacting them with DD issues.

My electric pre paid meter display went blank , after waiting for 1hour and 40 minutes my call was answered and then I was cut off. The next day this happened again , panicking I rung Citizens advice and asked if they could help me , they passed me to their support department where a lovely lady listened to my problem and said she would get in touch with BG , within half a hour a customer service agent from BG got in touch and arranged a appointment for a engineer to come and replace my gas and electric meters for smart ones. The lady from CAB rung me daily to make sure I was ok making sure my electric hadn't run out.  The day before the meters were due to be fitted had a text off BG cancelling my appointment because of lack of engineers , Citizens advice were notified by me of this and once again they got in touch with a Grace Walker from BG who then rung me and the appointment went ahead. I cannot thank Citizens advice enough for all there help if it wasn't for them I would probably be sitting here now with no electric supply. I URGE everyone to get in touch with citizens advice whether you are vulnerable or not to get the help you deserve because BG certainly don't care about their customers.

They do seem to be completely useless at the moment.  I ended up with British Gas after my own supplier collapsed.  They handled the switch-over OK, but now the supply of information has dried up.  I cannot view my energy usage, I can't find out what I owe them (or what they owe me) via the BG app, and it seems to be impossible to log in to their web site.  First it said my password was wrong (and I'm pretty sure it wasn't) then, when I tried to reset it, they sent me an expired reset link followed by no reset link at all; so I gave up and wrote them a complaint, which it'll take them a minimum of 7 days to even look at.  Possibly I'll need to sit on the phone for a couple of hours, to find out they can't help me at all . . .

Worst energy company I‚Äôve ever been with. Moved into a brand new build property and get go there was issues with the gas smart meter not communicating with there server. Apparently a 3 month wait for an engineer, what a joke. Then I asked to swap to pay as you go as I am a newly single parent and on benefits for the first time in my life so wanted to watch what I was using. I was told I couldn‚Äôt because I had to be a customer for 28 days 1st. So new customer you want to trust with having energy first rather than agreeing to let them pay first for what they use as they explained they didn‚Äôt want to get into debt with not knowing how much to budget for a bill. Now I have aired the 28 days and asked for my electric to be swapped to pay as you go. I was told I had to clear my bill first so I did of over ¬£50. I was then told the swap is complete as it is a mode change on the system with me having a smart meter and that when the switch happens I will revive a bill for the energy I have used in that crossover gap. That was fine as it wouldn‚Äôt be a lot. Now a week later you have taken the full bill for electricity again over ¬£50 and my gas bill again ¬£15. This has now left me overdrawn unexpectedly meaning if I don‚Äôt get this money back I will have bills I cannot pay this month and putting me in debt. So you told me I had to obtain meter readings and you would only refund me the difference of what I haven‚Äôt used. So still your penalising a single parent on benefits for your mistake! You are putting me in debt for your mistakes! So I cart my sick 2 year old outside with me to the meter cupboards as I‚Äôm a single parent and can‚Äôt leave him in the house unaccompanied. So I open the gas cupboard fine and then try the electric cupboard and there is a metal cap blocking me from unlocking the cupboard. Absolutely disgrace of a company. STAY WELL CLEAR!!!! I‚Äôm still waiting for this to be resolved!

I was told , when asked for a transcript of my chat, that I just had ‚Äòto click on the envelope on the top right‚Äô. On my app, there is no envelope! I have a Smart Meter but my bill shows a reading that is estimated. Why? This is a dreadful service!

I was switched from PFP to British Gas in sept 2021, I even contacted the ombudsman, Imade a simple request ""How much would my monlthly payments be"" I am still awitingan answer, the online information is not easyto follow. there is now an electric bill for over ¬£700+ but nothing to show how this has been worked out, I have called their number on 4 occasions this week and message state 20 min wait time, I have waited for over 45 mins and had no answer.  I spoke to someone on 22/5 after waiting nearly 1 Hour she said "" your bills from sept to 22 april are ¬£232 in debt for gas and ¬£67 in debt to electric and next bills not due until july"" so I want to know where the ¬£700+ has come from, I have todaybeen trying since 9am to go onlive chat, Ihave been disconnected twice passed to another agent 3 times and now they have ended the chat and sent me a linkto get large print bills, there is nothing wrong with my eyesight and a free gas check, I dont need this as the property is owned by the council they already do a free check, I am absolutely furious with british gas and do not know what to do next, I think they have seen ¬£singns and greadily taking on more than they can handle and all this to the detiment of its customers

Last time I complained I was told to contact them by Facebook. I don‚Äôt do Facebook! Two hours ago I received an email asking for meter readings. I‚Äôd already submitted meter readings & was told I would receive my first bill by 5th May. The past two hours have been spent trying to speak with someone. The two phone numbers I tried said the wait time was 45 minutes. Tried the chat line but Cosmo was a waste of time & I was 160 in the queue. Decided to wait & eventually, Shubham came on the line. She did help but I‚Äôm not satisfied with British Gas at all. Their customer service is virtually none existent! However, I have a feeling nothing will change & if British Gas think the level of service is acceptable heaven help us!

I used British Gas in the past and they never got my bill right, in fact they got it so wrong when I went to leave due to high monthly payments they managed to suddenly bill me for ¬£400.. I paid nonetheless and moved to Peoples Energy, great company but unfortunately soon after they went bust and I was absorbed back into the clusterfuck that is British Gas. Now according to their app they owe me ¬£600 so I am desperately looking forward to them telling me that's all a big mistake and I in fact owe them money again. 40-50 minute wait time on the phone and on live chat, useless twats.

In January I was taken over by British Gas (Ofgem's choice for me, not mine) after my previous supplier went bust. We're now into May and I still haven't had a clear, accurate bill from them which includes all my payments and credits to date. Also they omitted to set me up as a continuing Direct Debit customer, so have added an extra charge to my tariff. One employee I spoke to on the phone was pleasant enough but the call did not result in an inaccurate bill being sorted out. I just received a second inaccurate bill.

Over 1 hour wait time on complaint line and the app would not allow me to do it because it was registering smart meetings way after our move out date.

If there were minus stars I would give you minus 5.
I have been a dual fuel customer for 20 years. I referred a friend in December 2021, she signed up with British Gas as a dual fuel customer and has 2 direct debits with British Gas. However British Gas made a real hash of setting up her accounts, they kept setting her accounts at the wrong address and at one point she had at least 4 different account numbers.
We were both promised a reward of ¬£70 vouchers each, Injave lost count of the number of times I have called and emailed British Gas about this and the ridiculous replies I had had from the Customer Service, which is not fit for purpose.
I will never recommend anyone to join British Gas, you make false promises of rewards and have no intention of giving the reward to loyal customers.

What went wrong - this would be comparable to writing ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô.  The shortened version would be we received our first bill from you  on 14/04 with numerous errors, and  telling us our fixed term contract would be increased by some ¬£110 per month. An advisor was contacted and he was to ring me back on 19/04 with updated information. No such call was received. We then received  four/five envelopes on 22/04 from you with varied statements, again erroneous, but informed us we were on track with monthly payments and were also in credit to some ¬£727.  Made another call on 22/04. An advisor agreed these were incorrect and confusing and was to arrange for an amendment to our account, as he believed we‚Äôd been paying too much per month.  Not received, but received  a further letter on 27/04 telling us we owed you money and you had  closed our account and cancelled our direct debits. I rang again on 27/04 and spoke to a different advisor who apologised for error and I asked if this would be immediately reinstated and she promised to ring me back later that day.  Some three days later I am still waiting. Our account is still closed and I cannot speak to anyone as it is now a bank holiday weekend .  For information, we are old age pensioners with my partner suffering a heart condition. I cannot fault the attitude of your advisors, although they do not keep their promise to keep you informed or to contact you when agreed. Your app has been near to useless as there are always tech problems. Our smart meters have not been functioning correctly and you failed to inform us that you could not read our gas usage.  All in all we feel totally let down by your service and have no idea of how we are ever going to get a satisfactory outcome to the above. We have spent literally hours on the phone to your advisors with no resolution. I am so worried about this situation as currently it appears we have no contract with any supplier and you believe we owe you ¬£584 to be paid within seven days.  I would appreciate some immediate action to reinstate our account and an updated bill outlining our correct direct debit payments.

Pay a fortune already for Home Care. Charged ¬£50 excess for a fault caused by the service engineer bearing in mind we have never once needed to do a call out for it. The day it was serviced it developed a serious fault. Two separate customer service employees confirmed that the excess would be waived. Sent an invoice the next day. Next customer service employee incredibly rude and wouldn't let me get a word in. The one after that couldn't help but advised that they'd contact debt recovery agency if it wasn't paid. So left completely out of pocket for a fix that we didn't need until it was serviced. Appalling, avoid. I would say it's a waste of money, but it's that plus costing you even more when they break your boiler!

The service I received this Morning was absolutely appalling and utterly rude. First and foremost, for your Agent to ask me the reason I‚Äôm enquiring about a Bill increase might it be that I cannot afford it! The disrespect and rudeness were beyond me. Now as a British Gas customer I‚Äôm not allowed to enquire about a price increase that‚Äôs coming out of my Bank Account, ridiculous. Secondly, I didn‚Äôt even receive a notification from British Gas informing me about the price increase not even a letter, e-mail, text, or a phone call informing me that there might be an adjustment to your Gas/Electricity Bill. The lack of communication is unacceptable and inexcusable for a Company that prides itself on keeping their Customer informed with the latest updates. Thirdly, I‚Äôm trying to explain to your Agent where the Gas Meter is located but continuously keeps arguing with me about its location which was very frustrating and came across very arrogant. When I‚Äôm Physically here and someone is thousands of Miles away keeps arguing with me was very rude. And why doesn‚Äôt British Gas allow its Agents to give their last name not only their first names?

Homecare Central Heating Cover

I have been a british gas homecare customer for more than 10 years. My boiler has broken down and I have no hot water or heating.

I tried the website to book an appointment the website was down. I rang their service centre. I explained my problem and advised that my wife was suffering from terminal cancer and was very frail.

Their operative had two options for me. 1) Wait for 8 days for an engineers appointment or 2) Get someone else to fix it. Their operative was unhelpful in the extreme. This is April - not the depths of winter. Why anyone would pay ¬£60 per month for this appalling service is beyond me. You would be better off self insuring.

Direct debit will be cancelled tomorrow.

I've had Homecare for a while, and always been happy with it, but their service recently is absolutely disgraceful. DO NOT SIGN UP TO THEM. I reported a fault with my hot water 3 weeks ago. It took a week to get an engineer to attend. He couldn't fix it, arranged to come back with the part, and has now failed to attend twice with no warning, just hasn't turned up. Customer service is disgraceful, complaints take 6-8 to process, and I'm still yet to have the fault fixed.

British Gas has got to be the worst firm I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with . After moving into a 2 bedroom house me and my wife were told to pay 75 pound a month for both gas and electric . This we did until British Gas contacted us telling us we were paying too much and told us to reduce our payments , we queried this only to be reassured this was correct . How surprised we were when only in a matter of months British Gas contacted us telling us we were now 1500 in debt . After querying this and sending meter readings the new figure was 600 so where did 1500 come from ? We now agreed under duress to pay 140 and month to get the arrears down . Well a few months later here we go again we received a new statement saying saying we was both paying too much and paying too little who‚Äôs in charge of these clowns ? After another 50 minute phone call our payments have now increased to 250 a month and the last statement we received was wrong . Well who sent it then ? British Gas the firm who makes it up as they go along ‚Ä¶

Paid final bill about 2 years ago. Spent hours and days telling them with proof that payment had been made. They ignored my evidence and gave the 'debt' to an agency who came up with the usual threats. In a weak moment I paid the bill again thinking that would get rid of them. We are now on agency number 4. So 4 failures to collect, you'd think that would tell BG something, buy hey what do they care. Today I received the bill again after 2 years through their solicitor. Going to ignore it in the hope it goes to court where I can rip into them Compensation, return of monies paid and an apology.

A terribly organised company. The booking team books appointments and then can't find them. Not one person you speak to on the phone has any idea where or what the engineers are doing. 2 appointments booked for a smart meter and one appointment left without hot water over the weekend after being 'assured' someone will be out to sort it out. Not ONE engineer turned up. You take days off work, lose days' wages and they offer you ¬£30 for the missed appointment. They also book appointments telling you it's between certain times, without ever actually booking it, they message several third party engineers who IF they can do the job, will book you in. The people on the phones do not tell you this, you think you have an appointment. Worst company and service I have ever had the misfortune to do business with. Avoid like the plague.

They sent someone out to change my meter and told me that the bill would be wiped of as it was there mistake only to find out that they‚Äôve fitted a new machine with the bill on and there deducting ¬£13.50 out of ¬£15 that I top up! I rang them back and had to go through it all again, only for the customer service operator ‚Äúchad‚Äù to tell me that the reason I had a new gas meter fitted was because I couldn‚Äôt keep up with my bills! And there‚Äôs now no evidence that I had a pay as you go meter!

Pre paid meter display screen went blank the end of March , I panicked because of my electric running out.
After being in a queue a hour and forty minutes I managed to get through to customer service only to be hung up on. I tried the following day and was told I would be rung back after them saying I had to have smart meters fitted or pay ¬£130 for a ordainry meter .I didn't want smart meters but I had no choice as I wasn't prepared to pay for a ordainry meter again , bullying tactics by British gas. Surprise , surprise they didn't ring me back after she promised to. It was then that I got in touch with citizens advice and they immediately gave me a case number and rung British gas who then got in touch and gave me a appointment for 4 days later , I'm sure that you can guess that I received a message from British gas that due to unavailability of engineers that my appointment was cancelled . Quoting my case number I rung citizens advice and within a hour British gas got in touch and my appointment went ahead.
I urge customers of British gas to get in touch with citizens advice they were brilliant , I had regular phone calls off them to see if I was ok and I can't praise them enough.

I have a disabled wife with dementia who uses electric equipment and medication which must be stored in the fridge. Luckily my wife is in hospital at the moment. This totally unacceptable and shambolic. I am receiving bills which they expect me to pay that WILL NOT be happening.

BG have pretty much made me homeless. Tried to move address but their total failure to reconnect me at my new property left me with no alternative but to cancel my new tenancy. I spent three and a half working days to be put through to the billing department. One phone call lasted 1 hour and 42 minutes while they put me on hold. My phone went dead and I had to discreetly recharge it at the library. I am a pensioner and it's lucky for me that I left a couple of weeks crossover on my moving dates otherwise I would be sleeping in my car. I have written and complained to BG but it's no surprise that they haven't contacted me. As soon as I can I will go to the Ombudsman.

One star is being very generous, I have been with British Gas for 2 years and to say I am disgusted is an understatement.
Due to having a hospital procedure I had to move out of my property for 3 weeks (1 week hospital inpatient stay and 2 weeks recovery with family). My family checked on my house regularly and topped up my meter when it was low for me, on the final check before going home there was plenty of money on the meter and all the food they had just brought for me to move home with was put away in fridge and freezer. The day I was due to go home 3 days  later my family took my belongings for me before hand and all my electric was off and all food was defrosted. I contacted British Gas to let them know what had happened to see what was wrong for it to turn off and they told me this happens sometimes it‚Äôs the smart meter rebooting. I explained the situation regarding loss of food and why I wasn‚Äôt home when this happened and they told me that they don‚Äôt reimburse for food loss and nothing could be done. I requested to speak to a manger and place a complaint and was told I would receive a phone call within 4 hours‚Ä¶.a week later still no phone call. I then contacted them again and I was told all they could offer was ¬£30 on my meter and I explained I had done a whole months food stop and did not need money for electric which was already topped up but needed to replace the food lost so I could move back to my home with my 2 children including a baby. I then informed them that I would be taking this to social media so other family‚Äôs using this company can see how poorly single mothers are treated and I was hung up on. Do not use this company they do not care about family‚Äôs or helping correct there mistakes. Nearly 2 weeks later and still not resolved so I can move back home

Had a problem with a British Gas bill and phoned to speak to an advisor.  Due to waiting for someone to answer the time crept to after 5pm, I was pleased to see that you have an online customer chat service.  The customer service advisor called Felix was prompt, polite and extremely helpful.  I was very pleased to sort out the problem at the end of the working day.   I tried to complete a good survey for Felix at the end but clicked out by accident and the survey disappeared.  Please give Felix my thanks for their good service and thank you for having an option to speak online to a real person not a robot.  With thanks

Was moved here from Peoples Energy. I didn't rate Peoples Energy but they were leagues ahead of British Gas. Waited months for our first bill after being told ""it's coming"" and was told we owed ¬£250+ despite coming over from PE with a ¬£270 credit. They set up our direct debit for ¬£98 a month, which the website consistently states is 'not enough' despite still being in credit each month. 

Their website barely works, and cannot track our energy usage reliably. They constantly tell me to submit meter readings despite populating our bill with automatic ones, they refuse to change our billing period to monthly from quarterly, despite their website saying you can do so at any time, the bills frequently miss off the gas charge despite us being a dual fuel customer and to get the bill re-generated we have to sit for hours on the phone or live chat to get them to do it.

This has finally culminated in them just taking away the energy usage charts on our account on our website so we can't see what we're being charged and are just constantly being told ""You're not paying enough for your energy"" despite our bill saying we're now ¬£300 in credit, and when I queried this we were told it was because ""your meters aren't on our system and need to be set up by our engineering team"". 

British Gas are an absolute joke, and the only reason we haven't switched is because of all the havoc with the market right now preventing us from finding any deals - we don't even know how much our unit cost is now the price cap has been raised and BG won't tell us!

Stay away and go with another supplier if you have the choice. Their customer service and usability is the worst we've ever experienced, and we've been supplied by Npower!

They're an absolute joke.

No words to describe a customer service that is probably the worst I have ever experienced. I've been using chat to contact them as its quicker to fly to the moon, than get an answer. Yesterday I spent over an hour trying to cancel my homcare, to be told at the end of the conversation to contact them through a phone call. You cannot make it up. If I could give a minus to the review I would.

Had a credit for ¬£28, gave my readings 31/03 for Gas and Electricity, credit went up ¬£235, then changed to ¬£12.14, ¬£16 had disappeared from my credit emailed them about the above, also asked them could they explain the reversal payments on my account, the account are impossible to understand, did not reply of which I am not surprised, no doubt if I did not pay my bill I would probably get a letter from them, they are the worst, if they had dynamite for brain's they couldn't blow their hat's off, British Gas, more like British Trash

British Gas is a shambles, I have a smart meter for electric only, as I have had 3 different guys here to get gas side to work, but hey ho none of them has succeeded, I received a txt message on 31/03/2022 to ask for my meter readings, which I promptly sent by return, I have since had another message to say they had not received it. 4 xTimes I have sent it, I now have a message tonight 9/04/2022 to say they still have Not received it.

I have a smart meter that I charged on Wednesday. The electricity payment went through but after several attempts the payment was refused for gas despite sufficient funds available. I checked my bank account and found my bank had paid the gas which to this date does not appear on the meter as a credit.

Have  problem with their pre pay meters. In a month and a half I had same problem 3 times and always the gas supply was off because of an error on the gas meter. I've been advised by them to change it to smart meters and now the top up doesn't go through. Again without heating or hot water in the winter time. Their chat helpline is completely useless. Last time I've been told an engineer will come, never showed up. 2 days with no gas. Definitely not recommended.

Awful service. Got an email to phone a certain number to a specific number, only to be told I had been put through to the wrong department and that the correct department for the day, by a customer service representative who had a virtually incoherent indistinguishable strong accent, who spoke over me. I eventually had to shout at her to tell her to shut up and give me a chance to complete answers I was asked. All this after having to wait incredibly long periods and options that does not accommodate non customers. Dreadful - it's no wonder British Gas have the notorious reputation for having one of, if not the worst in customer service. If it was just down to service I doubt the organisation would last long. Good riddance to a company that absurdly has the monopoly in gas energy. A word of advice - if you can - avoid BG at ALL costs.

We were supplied by Scottish Gas for one week when we moved in, before Octopus took over.

They charged ¬£14 for one week's electricity. Fine, whatever, they specifically said there was no bill for gas as we hadn't used any, as per their smart meter.

Today they sent their lawyers after us to reclaim '¬£94 in missed bills' which we never received and were told didn't exist.

Basically my electric and gas company Bristol energy went bust, and I was switched to British gas, and this was in January, and it is now April, and basically while I was with Bristol energy, there was major issues with the company that they use to read the meters , read them wrong 5 times, so Bristol energy put my account on hold, and did a complaint about the meter readings, and booked another one in December,as we are on the priority meter reading list, but asked us to monitor the meter reading person, we did this and yet again he was about to do the same, and my husband said you are doing it wrong, he walked off and to speak to his boss on the phone, and while he was gone , my husband took pictures of the meter readings, and eventually the meter reading person came back and agreed that he was doing it wrong, and he did something then walked off , and later my husband sent the pictures of the readings to Bristol energy, but when British gas called me last week they said that a final bill was done from my previous supplier Bristol energy, but when she told me the meter readings, they was not the ones done in December they were the disputed meter readings that had been causing issues with my Bristol energy bills, so basically Bristol energy administration team have sent the wrong meter readings, and my husband even repeated over the phone to British gas , the meter readings, so the lady who was on the phone, said that they would have to sort it out, and someone will call you on Monday and no one has contacted me yet, and basically they sent me a week later a holding letter, delaying everything again, and the meter readings day has passed not very impressed with this situation, it is not doing my stress levels at all, but no one seems to care

Supply took over by British gas after collapse of People's Energy September 21.
Expected teething problems but have never known anything like it......

Welcome don't do anything we will take over your DD....you don't have to do anything.
Err Nothing 2 months later.
Made emergency voluntary payment after 2 months at Xmas knowing debt only builds........till my first DD kicked in January....based on?????
Rang to ask what, when,where am I up to what is my monthly average what is my true balance so I can educated guess my payments.........as by January had only received a no sense no correct info bill and another not due till April!!!!!
Asked for monthly bill in meantime so can follow....don't do only quarterly (more potential underpayment time)

Answer don't worry if you owe we will bill you in April....a fortune of debt of course....if I had not acted......

The app is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
Despite monthly uploading of my readings you don't get any real time balance....whilst guessing where are you up to.......especially as a new customer now in a different  payment deal than before with clear online balance/usage at all times.......am now in a secret one.
 The direct debit app advice randomly goes up and down with no clue where the figure comes from......as yet no 2nd bill to compare to the 1st...
No clue if it true usage or includes previous credit now transfered to my account....all part of the secret.

And all this before the massive increases to come.

All I want is accurate regular information I can monitor so I can keep up to date with my payments......
I have had resorted to paying extra money on account ready for the suprise catch up bill in April.....
Am sure many people will not have done and will get more than a shock when after 6 months after takeover they finally see their true balance......just before it shoots up again.
Have no problem taking on responsibility paying without being asked as common sense tells me the buck will land on my toes when it all becomes clear... 
But 6 months of nothing accurate to guess on or no information due to quarterly billing....when bill one was not up to date and bill 2 not even landed yet.....
Need a crystal ball.....
And an advisor who I can understand a word of ....and had no answers to the most basic questions part from oh don't worry April bill will have caught up.
Thanks...... that be 6 months after takeover before have slightest clue.....

They promise to call you but they never call you back. Someone I spoke have changed my bill date when I asked for something else and I didnt even have enough money on my account!!!! 
I have booked 3 appointment for the smart meter and each time I took a time off but No one turn up . They said I will get ¬£90 compensation and am still waiting. 

Sick of it!!

Am definitely leaving British Gas

I‚Äôd thought that my 98 year old mother was just unlucky in the way that she was treated by British Gas. A quick look a rating of 1.3 out of 5 tells its own story not to mention the number of ‚Äòsorrys‚Äô on the forum (doubtless there‚Äôll be another now).  My mother was left distressed after three slot appointments were missed. One unscheduled visit occurred surprisingly late at night when she was in bed.  Engineer put a card through the door. Two appointments were no shows. On another occasion the Engineer failed to knock, put a card through the door and charged off.  Engineers no longer phone ahead when they are on their way.    I suppose disgraceful covers this saga.  There are other words.

Just what is wrong with your online account website, Energy usage has not been updated since February 16th for electric, no energy usage for gas at all, I recently moved house in January and had letters to say my account was up and running and information was being updated correctly from the smart meters. Meter readings are  updated on the main gas and electric pages but looking at historical meter reads they show the initial estimated reading even though I supplied readings when I moved in. I had smart meters installed at my previous residence in 2017 and information displayed was very good and informative, continuous upgrades to the website have gradually removed information available to the effect that it is now a third rate service, upgrades to the website are just beneficial to British Gas and not the consumer, it is like they do not want the consumer to question what is shown, just the minimum info now. Smart meters were supposed to supply information to help you budget and take control of your energy usage. As it stands at the moment I cannot do any of this, it is very frustrating, no information so I can control my energy usage other than it is quick to tell you to adjust your direct debit up. I have no display at this residence and the one at the previous house failed to display correctly from day one, I complained about this to BG and to the energy ombudsman, the bottom line was there was a software problem that was known about and BG could not give a date to fix it and closed out the complaint, it is a joke.
Ways of contacting BG to complain have been degraded, long telephone waiting times and anything other than billing you have to go on the chat, another nightmare, I want to be able to talk to someone or at least by email.
I worked for many years on oil and gas metering and we would not accept a performance like this from a supplier or to who we supplied to but BG seem to be able to get away with this.
Will see what happens on 1st. April once the price cap is removed and if the system starts to show correct data.
Come on BG you cam do better than this.

Absolutely useless company. Switched to them in September 2021 and not had a bill or been able to login since then (the direct debit of course takes money every month). Their website and app continuously say 'Oops something went wrong' or 'we are having problems try later' when logging in, the chat system, never cnnects to a real person (even after many hours) and its impossible to phone them as they are too busy. I have smart meters but they keep asking for meter readings which I can't provide because their site never works. Surely I have a legal right to see how much I am being billed each month? If there are tech problems with sites or apps then they should be forced to send out the bill via the post. Unfortunately British gas is one of only a handful of energy companies left now so not much choice.

I have had a service account for 6 years with British Gas. I have had one service in 3 years granted we were in a pandemic but still paid my money every month! It took me weeks to get a service booked for this year but before the appointment my boiler broke down, took about an hour to try speaking to someone who told me I was not vulnerable and would have to wait 5 days without heating and hot water!! We decided to cancel our account which I pay nearly ¬£400 a year for. I went on to live chat to complain and after explaining my cause I was told I would get a refund of ¬£400.08 but British Gas decided they would only pay me ¬£166.77, when I went back on to complain again I was told I was not entitled to anymore even though they admitted I hadn‚Äôt received a service in a year and a half.. disgusting company that takes your money and gives you nothing in return!!

MARCH 2022 - Never, ever, have I had to deal with a company as seriously bad as this.  They took over our energy supply, without problem, from Neon Reef who went into liquidation - all good.  Problems started when I wanted to pay the first bill.  I have managed to get on the app twice in 6 months.  Tried to call, couldn't speak to a human!  Done online chat, unsolved.  Yesterday, after receiving an email to say my bill was ready - again - managed to get on the app for only the second time, said was ¬£283 in credit.  Couldn‚Äôt download bills, there was a problem when tried to request paper ones, couldn‚Äôt have them either.  Tried to live chat three times, each time over 100 in the queue, waited and waited, but waited so long was cut off.  Tried this cycle three times. Today, we owe ¬£600 and something pounds, still no accessible bills, no live chat available and can‚Äôt speak to any human.  Beyond frustrated, just paid the bill.  Where do I go from here!!?? Would like someone from British Gas to contact me!!!

British Gas is an absolutely disgusting company. An account I was unaware of was taken out in my name and I have been charged nearly ¬£150 a year later for something I was completely unaware about. They passed this on to a debt collection agency and after I paid the bill in full they are refusing to take my calls and let the debt collection agency know that the bill has been paid causing me to be harassed by potential bailiffs and warning letters and emails.

For 9 years I jogged along as a British Gas customer, no real issues.  In April 2021 I‚Äôm told my account is being moved to British Gas Evolve(no choice in the matter!).  My two smart meters ceased to be smart overnight, and I was constantly told to submit meter readings.  As a disabled person I find it impossible to read a meter at ground level.  I informed BGE of my inability to read meters and asked for replacement smart meters, to no avail.  Since April 2021 I have had no statements, I can see no bills and no direct debits showing, although I can see they have been taken from my bank account.  Recently I called and asked for a paper statement, only to be sent one with items listed as ‚ÄúMiscellaneous documents‚Äù, ‚Äúreversals‚Äù ‚Ä¶..anyone know what these are?, the customer service personnel certainly don‚Äôt!  November 2021 I‚Äôm informed I‚Äôm being transferred back to BG‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôll be seamless‚Ä¶..haha.!  Now according to BG I have 2 accounts with them!  Apparently I have to ‚Äúbe careful when I sign in to make sure I‚Äôm in the correct account‚Äù‚Ä¶..a gem of advice given when I rang for clarification.   It‚Äôs a total joke.  I still can‚Äôt see any bills, direct debits, energy usage, order a new smart meter, website and App is cr**!

Took out boiler cover in January 22 waited 8 weeks for a service. Should have turned up to between 8am and 12 never turned up. When I rang to see why was told the engineer had gone home sick. Asked why I wasn't informed of this she never really had an answer.so now I have to wait till 26th  April for my service. You would think they would fit you in early as they had let you down, people get sick I know,but could they not ring you and let you know. ¬£270 a year for rubbish service. My wife and I are both in our 70s it's a good job it wasn't really cold. 4 hours without heating. All they do do was let us know,  if I wouldn't have rung I would still be waiting,

The worst customer service I have ever expressed. The people on the helpline, put you on hold and forget your there. Tell you its not a problem if an engineer makes you wait all day and comes to the property to say he can't do anything. Because technically he still came.

Honestly I can't express enough how bad he service is. I was told they would not pay compensation for their service because they hadn't done anything that bad, because there were no fatalities. So if no dies, they consider there service okay.

Non stop issues since switching to British Gas. First they got the switch wrong and took over my neighbour's supply, took months to resolve that. Now since August I've been trying to get a smart credit meter fitted and they keep cancelling the appointment. When I call up they show no empathy or even understanding of the issue. They have a script they stick to and have no knowledge outside of it. I've had multiple false promises and assurances, failed call backs, promised refunds that I have had to chase. Still no smart meter. Worst company I have ever dealt with. They don't care and aren't afraid to hide it. One member of staff just laughed down the phone and offered no solution.

British Gas robbed me!

I‚Äôm not exaggerating, nor did I want to get to this point - but I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôm aware that maybe other people have had a positive experience with British Gas but I‚Äôm not one of them.

I‚Äôve moved into a new property and was cursed with dealing with British Gas until my new supplier takes over. I‚Äôm on a pay as you go contract, and I topped up ¬£40 on my card. I was left without hot water and heating for 24 hours! 

A British Gas engineer came by and checked my meter. He said I‚Äôd been paying off the previous tenant‚Äôs debt. 

So I contacted the customer service and they first tried to fool me wanting to credit me only ¬£20. After some push back, I was granted ¬£50. The agent said I‚Äôd receive a new card with the credit in 4 days. 

Needless to say, the card never arrived.

I reached out again and a very rude agent convinced me to go ask for clarification to the off licence where I topped up. The guys had no clue what I was talking about - of course.

So now, not only have I been robbed ¬£40, been fooled and mistreated by agents, I‚Äôm also having to top up more and more.

I‚Äôve never been scammed so badly in my life. Beware of British Gas! They‚Äôll try anything to steal your money.

British Gas is a disgrace. They supply my property both electricity and gas; they are constantly mismanaging my accounts and inflating my gas account with additional charges, and threats of debt collection when most of the time my account is in credit. I have been in dispute with the company over 3 years regarding the location of my electric meter, which is on my neighbours property, and, I have difficulty accessing the meter.

I have been trying to get them to move the meter. I have tried everything from accepting products offered to me such as the Smart meter; each time they come to install the meter they return with it. They tried to enforce a prepaid meter and got a warrant to enter my property to remove something that isn't there. I don't have an issue with the Pre-paid meter, but I do have an issue with the fact that their warrant agent accompanied by locksmith's tried to force entry into my property without first knocking to see if there was anyone at home when their equipment is no where near my property and in the process caused damage to my property.

I complaint, they refuse to accept responsibility for their action.  They sent me a deadlock letter, I went to the Ombudsman Services to make a complaint; my complaint was accept; however, weeks later the Ombudsman closed my case because BG queried Ombudsman acceptance of my case and basically lied to them about the length of my complaint being under 8 weeks, when, it had been 7 months. They can move the meter, I got assurance from UK Power Network, but BG refuse to assist me; they refuse to take accountability for attempting force entry into my property and the trauma caused, but instead have taken me to court for debt. 
Shame on you BG/Centrica, shows how much you're not listening to your customers.

I‚Äôve been having issues since the 5th of November, they entirely cut me off supply for my gas and said they‚Äôd booked an engineer as I have a daughter with a heart problem. An engineer wasn‚Äôt booked and I had to wait for a week for an engineer, my daughter caught a chest infection thank fully she was only hospitalised for a day. I topped up both my gas and electricity with the card sent to me by British Gas but the credit wasn‚Äôt transferring to my meter and I was being told I didn‚Äôt have a smart meter which baffled me. The call centre staff are useless and hang up the first opportunity they get even if you show the slight bit of frustration towards the service. They blocked my move to another provider claiming I owed them money which is pretty much impossible on a prepayment metre, I contacted the energy ombudsman as after 2 months British Gas had not addressed my complaint despite them sending out 4 engineers by this point and still my meters were not accepting the credit I was topping up despite British Gas advising they could see my top ups, the amounts and even the times I topped up. I had a gas engineer come out 2 days ago and have had to have another one come out tonight for my electricity as I‚Äôve topped up ¬£40 and I still don‚Äôt have electricity. I would recommend everyone contact the energy ombudsman as this is the only way they‚Äôll offer a proper service, the engineer himself told me about how many complaints they‚Äôve been getting. I‚Äôm just hoping now that the ombudsman have advised British gas that they have to let me switch that this will happen sooner rather than later. Sorry for everyone else who is having issues but it‚Äôs winter we all need energy to get through this period and not only are they not giving me energy they‚Äôre certainly draining all of mine

Do not go with this company, I can‚Äôt wait for Utlita to have new customers again. Where do I start? To access the emergency credit you have to go the smart meter which is OUTSIDE. I am heavily pregnant, with a son. So today on the 24/02/2022 I have been standing outside the rain for 30 mins, because they don‚Äôt know what they are doing. Two of them put the phone down on me, because I am getting annoyed with them because I‚Äôm going to give birth in 6 weeks. There charges are a joke I put on 30 pound on and I kid you not that goes so quick. I can‚Äôt wait to leave them, Utlita is so much easier you get 15 pound emergency, there charges are super cheap! I put 30 pound electric on and it last me over a month. I don‚Äôt have the stress of worrying when my electricity is gonna run out, with British Gas I do. I can not voice how angry I am, I am still standing outside I have been on the phone for 20mins still and this is my 4th call. I HATE British Gas. I Never hated anything in my life.  I‚Äôm waiting untill the middle of March then I‚Äôm going back with Utlita.

My boiler job has been absolute nightmare!
All I need to do is buy a new boiler and have it fitted but because of these so called regulations.I have to have a joiner to remove a box around my boiler,a builder who can fit two more shafts and possibly have my boiler moved to the other side of kitchen.Other companies have had other people in their companies to at least share the work and said I don‚Äôt need big shafts.I‚Äôm angry because you say you only deal with gas.Stop selling boilers or employ builders,joiners, Plasteres who can do the other job.Other good companies have said I don‚Äôt need my boiler moved to other side of kitchen!!Stop changing regulations because you‚Äôll lose customers because you‚Äôre just a gas company.Not good enough,you obviously don‚Äôt care as long as you get paid.!!!!

I have a Boiler contract that is an annual repair contract. Each year it the renewal goes up by about 50% and I have to negotiate a discount. This has been happening for 12years.
This year I am having my property refurbished and need to move out for 6 months. 
I asked for my contract to be transferred to the new property.
This cannot be done so BG will not terminate my contract in the property to be refurbished therefore I have to continue paying until the end of the contract ie ¬£90 and take out a new contract on the home I am moving to for 6months at double the cost because they will not give me the discount. The cost for 6months is ¬£200 .... lost ¬£90 plus for 6months at ¬£140 at the new property.
This is what loyalty for 12yrs gets you... NOTHING!!!!!!!!

Just been on to BG because according to online account we are in credit by ¬£462, ask for rebate or lower the standing order, BG response was to check account, the took ¬£435 in energy charges and said you are now only ¬£26 in credit and you need to up your direct debit, when we asked what is the point of the smart meter and online account we were  told it was to give accurate meter readings and up to date information. What a load of rubbish, so what they mean is do not take any notice of the meter or do not go on line and look at your account because that is not up to date either. So you charge more nad do even less, what a rip off and misleading company you are. And please do ask me to contact your through social media because we do not have these, we have an on line account to contact you were it is totally impossible to contact you because according to your virtual assistant all your operatives are busy and I am now leaving the chat, REALLY GREAT HELP, can't  get hold of you on line and then cut off by a robot, and then you have to phone and wait to get through to somebody who you can hardly understand and completely uninterested!

Booked a service, no one turned up, days holiday wasted, re booked another appointment, another company turned up, adviced not to use the boiler, they did not have a part to fix the problem, call from British gas wanting to send someone out in three days time, explained we had no hot water and no heating, explained that there was a vulnerable person at the property, British gas engineer turned up within a few hours and said there was nothing wrong with the boiler.

My mother's boiler broke down just before Christmas 2021 . She has homecare plan. She is 87 and in poor health. Trying to phone for an engineer is a joke. Took ages before I could talk to a human being. Customer service said it would be three weeks before anyone could come out. Explained She is housebound and a lot of medical  conditions. Was asked all about her medical problems before person on the phone spoke to her manager and got it brought forward . Best they could do was a week later. Was told if not happy get a boiler repair from another company and send them the invoice. That's what I did. What a joke . Homecare  cover a scam. She has had two rescheduled boiler  service appointments as well. Brittish gas taking money for a service that is a disgrace . Would not give any stars at all if it let me.

They messed up my late father's bills for 4 years - saying he was in debt when he was in credit and saying he was in credit when he was in debt. He always paid by direct debit and the amount was set by them. 

This only can't to light since his passing. Now they lie to me about calling me back. One manager from the bereavement team promised on Friday that he'd call me the following Tuesday. When I rang the third time to ask when he would call me, I was told he was on annual leave and clearly lied when he said he'd ring me. I was then told another manager would ring me straight back. No one rang me back.

Absolutely shocking! Unlike other energy suppliers, British Gas do not adjust your bills, which has left me over ¬£150 in debit. The customer service on the online chat is totally apalling - no idea how they get away with calling it customer care! I have wasted 2 hours to be passed from one person to the next, and the agents transfer the conversation without excusing themselves and without any explanation.
Home Service is also a scam! Had a plumber out to fix a leak underneath my toilet. There was a wooden access point underneath the toilet but the plumber, destroyed all the surrounding tiles, which customer service assured me was covered. My bathroom was left in an absolute state, and the whole flooring now needs replaced. It was not covered and the plumber even left his empty can of juice! So unprofessional!

A total shambles - use another provider!!  

After confirming our move in date to our new house and selecting a tariff it was relayed to me over the phone that my account had been set up and the transfer from the previous tenant would commence soon. No further details from me required. My bank details were taken and a direct debit set up. 

Two weeks on, and my account is apparently incomplete and no records of my payment had been taken. 

Fighting an uphill battle to connect with the British Gas team, the website was co stand under maintenance and customer service e queries via the phone went either unanswered or were cut off once the call agent explained the system was failing.

The service we have received from British Gas has been absolutely appalling. If you are thinking of taking out a Homecare package with them please do not bother. You cannot book an appointment online as they are always not available, the live chat cuts you off and then you speak to somebody you are likely to have to wait 6 weeks for a service and then they cancel it on the day. This has happened to me twice now. Also when we have had no hot water we could not get anybody out for 2 weeks (originally it was 4 weeks). There must be a better provider to service your boiler (who might actually turn up in a timely manner). I am paying ¬£45 a month for this service, I really wish I had not renewed but at that point I was still waiting for my service.

My wife and I are both pensioners and depend on our home being warm throughout the winter period. I have tried to contact British Gas HomeCare as we have not had our boiler serviced since December 2020, and we are extremely concerned that our boiler may breakdown due to the lack of service provided? 
We pay over ¬£400 per annum out of our pensions for a service that we are not receiving.

Each time I try to book a service, I get the same response - blaming Covid for lack of service? 

On contacting Live Chat I was processed through to another department by Ali (I have kept a screen shot of this futile conversation) - I was further kept waiting on Live Chat and after almost one hour I got cut off, and ironically asked to complete a customer care questionnaire? Its beyond belief..... 

The manner in which we are being treated is totally unacceptable and I have now decided to cancel my account with British Gas tomorrow and go to a small reliable company that value their customers and treat you with respect. 

Strange situation when a national company cannot fulfil their servicing contract due to 'Covid', yet a small privately run firm can????

You're the worse. Terrible service. We pay for your care plan. Our boiler stopped working last week, so we had no heating or hot water.

One of your staff even tried to blame my wife, and was rude and unpleasant. We don't know what we get for our care plan of ¬£38 per month. But we will cancel that now and advise everyone to stop. You're better off saving that payment monthly and getting a decent, independent professional plumber when you need one.  And stop these inept companies earning such huge profits.

The Homecare service has gone rapidly downhill over the last 15 years. In the last 4-5 years thet have either cancelled the appointment the day before or not turned up on the day, so it was no surprise when they phoned last month the day before my service and radiator repair to cancel. After being assured as I've been cancelled once I should have no issue with the rearranged appointment. 
Today they rang and cancelled again. This is the most shocking useless shower I have ever come across. They are taking money for a service they can't provide. Only the age of my bolier stops me changing. I hate this company with a passion and I recommend anyone to go elsewhere if they can.

I was moved to British gas after People Enery went into receivership.  I have been trying to set up a direct debit to pay my bill yet still not been able to.  When you phone they do not answer or move you from department to department and then you suddenly get cut off and have to start the process all over again.
I have come from a company that had a high customer care to a company that do not care about the customer.  
Last time I spoke to an adviser they told be that I could not set up a direct debit as my electric smart meter is not working this time my gas meter is not working?

Dreadful customer service. You try to get assistance at the moment and all their operatives are good for is cutting the phone call off or terminating the live chat (after shunting you from one long queue to another, leaving you enraged and with the same problem you had to start with). USELESS!!! And all this because they ignored a ""reschedule"" text for a meter installation.

Arranged a BG engineer to come and service my heating boiler, Friday 26th Nov. Also asked that someone look at why radiators were no longer coming up to temp.  didn't get a BG engineer, got a subcontractor, who wouldn't loot at the radiator problem and the service took around 10 mins!   Made another appointment for 2nd Dec. BG engineer this time who (fare play) checked everything and said there is a blockage and he would arrange for dynorod to come with ""Thermal imaging gear"" to fine it.  heard nothing for a week and finally chased it up, having to phone Dyno myself who told me they would con on 21st Dec.  they came and spent the day banging all my radiators and finally said it requires a Power Flush to clear the dirt out of the system and they would go and recommend it to BG.  Meantime I had arranged another call because the boiler was now making a noise when the pilot light ignited, for 7th Jan but also called to complain and make sure the power flush was being arranged.  BG said they knew nothing about it but would pass that on to the visiting engineer.  I got another subcontractor who couldn't get out of the house fast enough but, did arrange a propper BG guy to come the same day.  This guy made the recommendation for a Power flush Quote which, I have accepted.  As I missed the phone call to arrange a date, I called again only to have they tell me I had not accepted the quote yet (even though I had the return acceptance email in front of me at the time).  I'm now waiting for a return call to confirm when a proper British Gas engineer can come and do the Power Flush. 

I note that, as soon as I raised a complaint they wanted to give 30 pounds to close it right away!  Followed by ""what if we make it 50 pounds!!"" 

Even though it turned out that dyno rod had recommended the power flush, I was told that a recommendation from them meant nothing to British Gas...

Conclusions: Even when you call them up they don't look for all the details related to your case.  
They don't follow up or communicate internally.
They still send emails asking me to arrange a service.

Appalling product, appalling service. New boiler and tank fitted 18 months ago. It keeps cutting out, losing pressure and we don't have hot water or central heating. We have called BG out 5 times as part of our Homecare plan. They are slow to respond, tried to go to an address we lived at 25 years ago! promised they would be here before 6pm today, didn't turn up then claimed they were booked for the next day (which they weren't). We had a service booked for next week which they can't find any record of and cancelled without telling us. I wouldn't trust this company to run bath. Terrible service.

British Has Home Service is a waste of money. I've witnessed the gradual decline in services over the past 15 years. 
I've had appointments for servicing cancelled 2hours before engineer was due. Another service scheduled on Nov25 2021 was cancelled, my son only discovering this when due to my experience, he phoned to confirm. It was moved to Jan 14 2022, Today! You guessed it CANCELLED. My son,  a care worker, takes days off for the these  ""SERVICES"" We were told, at 4oclock, when we phoned to check,that service would go ahead. Two hours later a phone call from a very polite young man informed my son it was cancelled AGAIN! Apparently customers with faulty equipment or lack of heating are prioritised.
I thought the actual reason for taking out Home Care is to ensure that potential faults are noticed and preventative intervention carried out.
We are paying to receive 
NO SERVICE UNLESS THERE'S PROBLEM!
THAT'S NOT HOME CARE. IT'S HOME DON'T CARE.
I'm cancelling 2agreements today
Good luck Jan Siber new Home Care Managing Director.

Took out boiler maintenance contract with British Gas. It had been only a few weeks since one of their engineer had come out and serviced the boiler, he failed to realise it was in an unusable bad state and left it running saying it was fine, few weeks later it brokedown in the middle of winter we were without hot water, when I requested for an engineer I was told their engineers were on strike and that I should contact another company to get it looked at. I was quoted between ¬£300.00 to ¬£500.00 an hour, when I informed British Gas of these extortionate costs they said it was not their problem that I could not afford it. Luckily a friend suggested I try a company he knew off who charged ¬£110.00 to tell me the boiler is in a very dangerous state and that it was beyond repair, I was also told that the British Engineer who last serviced it should have realised the boiler was in a dangerous state. British Gas quoted me ¬£3500 for a new boiler install, I got the job done for only ¬£1800 by another comapany. 
Not did they only leave my family with a boiler in dangerous state they were inconsiderate and uninterested in providing any form of help at our desperate hour, yet they had our money for the year's contract..I will never use this company again! They sent out a cowboy engineer who did not know what he was doing? and left us with a dangerous faulty boiler in running state.

Having been with British Gas Homecare for many years and have seen a decline in service on all areas - boiler service, drainage and small electrical items.
So much so that we removed small appliance repairs from our contract as very disappointed with the service received. 
We opted to have a new boiler fitted from British Gas with services included in the contract, unfortunately since being fitted November 2019 they have cancelled the scheduled appointment - very poor and not what we signed up for.
Drainage is a dreadful service- had an issue with our downstairs toilet- appointment made no show, rescheduled and engineer turned up but didn‚Äôt have the correct part even though I had sent photos and details of the toilet make. Next appointment showed up still not correct flusher finally after making a complaint turned up at scheduled time with correct part. This resulted in me having to take 4 1/2 day holidays. Absolutely appalling service.

I cannot recommend the platinum service cover from British Gas due to their poor service and customer care

I have had British Gas Homecare cover for many years but I have noticed a sharp decline in the service they provide. The latest event happened on New Years Eve when my boiler failed and a call the Homecare proved very disappointing. The earliest date for an engineer to visit was 16 Jan 22. As per the terms and conditions they asked me to find and pay a local engineer and they would refund minus the ¬£60 excess. They never offered to locate the engineer for me. My boiler was eventually fixed by an independent engineer who informed me the vent siphon was blocked by years of debris which should have been removed by the British Gas engineer during the annual service.  I've cancelled my Homecare contract with immediate effect.

Lost all confidence, used British Gas for 9 years with my company and my bill has doubled over nyt, renewed every year without a thought as I trusted the company only to find they f*^ked me over with small print I didn‚Äôt read (dyslexic) BYE BYE. I‚Äôve learnt my lesson.

It was very underhand sending out a slip for me to sign for another year with British Gas knowing you had doubled the tariff (from 19p-41pkWh) and not giving me the option to call and negotiate a new tariff or to be able to shop around. My contract is only a year I am very lucky and there are plenty of other companies that can do a better deal than you.

I received a letter telling me that I had a new insurance policy with Homecare that I knew nothing about. It is free - so long as I remember to cancel next year. Otherwise they charge me ¬£96. I didn‚Äôt ask for it and don‚Äôt need it since it doesn‚Äôt cover underfloor heating, which we have.
The letter telling me about this arrived after the 14 day cooling off period had expired.

This company is a disgrace. I purchased a property with the intention to rent it out so live 300 miles away. It currently has top up meters but I requested these be changed to credit meters. I spoke to several agents in South Africa mid December - most of whom don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing or talking about - and the engineer is arranged for today, 3 weeks later. Yesterday, I received an SMS with a top up code. The agent has mistakenly arranged for another top up meter to be installed, despite my having passed all the credit checks. I was told yesterday that the engineer can‚Äôt be contacted so that s/he can fit the correct meter but I can change the mode once this one is fitted. I‚Äôm still not sure if this is true.

Had a faulty carbon monoxide detector which resulted in our gas supply being switched off - no complaints whatsoever with the service provided by SIG which  was excellent - unfortunately the opposite as true when it came to British Gas. I nitially was told it would be two weeks before an engineer could visit but that was then reduced to 8 days meaning that we had no heating or cooking facilities. Unable to speak to anyone in person and felt that the chat service was totally unaccepable. Arranged to have a local gas engineer check out our appliances and am presently trying (unsuccessfully) to contact someone to cancel our home care cover which we have had for more than 20 years.

BGS customer; booked an appointment for a faulty cistern start of November. Earliest appointment they would come out was 4 weeks!
Fine, covid, priorities, etc. The day comes and goes, no word from dyno, no engineer, no call from their office. Nothing.
Complaint made to BGS, appt rebooked for another 3 weeks later (21st Dec)! Afternoon of the day, left a voicemail from their office, appt cancelled and rebooked for 6th Jan. I call BG and complain. Rebooked for 22nd.
Afternoon of 22nd, call from the dyno office, cancelled again and moved to 6th Jan.
So we will be 9 weeks into the process and zero faith the plumber will actually even show up on the 6th of Jan.
In addition, the last 2 years in a row I've had to call in and complain to ensure my boiler is actually serviced in a timely manner by BG Services, instead of leaving it up to 18 months between services (used to be 12, this has been changed without consultation over time), putting our families lives and property in danger.
BGS Homecare used to be a great product, it's now a total shambles and not worth a single penny, indeed it's currently costing me (money) and the environment (in wasted leaking water).
Moving forward I will be putting that money in a savings account each month instead and using local tradespeople. What an abysmal state for a once great services company to reach...

I had several business energy accounts with BG.
I moved them all as soon as i could due to poor customer service skills and poor understanding of their customer needs and complaints.( I had to sell one site due to an obviously faulty meter that they could not resolve due to incompetency on their part)
The last account to move last week was blocked as apparently I had not given notice.I am positive that i did but with all that is going on at the moment and trying to keep a business afloat during these challenging times one would think BG would be more sympathetic but unfortunately not.They have lost thousands of pounds with my business moving ( no exaggeration) and I will never go back!Their sales team constantly call for business and cannot understand why their customer service team are so narrow minded and prepared to lose business.

Let me start by saying.... as far as they are able BG staff have been kind, helpful and professional on any occasion I have had to deal with Customer Service there.  Yet, I draw your attention to the first part ""as far as they are able""!  

The greedy (let's face it - thieves) owners and share-holders wish it that way.  These people have no care for other people, least of all their customers, less the service the customers provide to these scum.

Ownership of this company control the way Customer Service operates and limits their ability to deal with real problems.  Simply... problems cause these (and I'm being complementary here) parasites money.

My issue is this, tried to leave at least 4 times.  Initially BG would not let me go, and when I did get free they pulled me back without my consent from my new company.  

Not happy with that they've just presented me with a ¬£130 bill for one month (ESTIMATED), when my usual is about ¬£25 with any decent firm.

An engineer was booked for the following Tuesday, however since then my kitchen ceiling is leaking, i have no Heating or water
So i called them on 3 occasions and for some reason each call was ended half way through conversation, until i phoned again and asked for their name.

An engineer was booked for this morning Sat 18th, i contacted them just to be sure they were attending because i was advised by a friend that they don't turn up.
The customer services representative informed me the appointment wasn't booked in, but someone will come this afternoon.
I have just received a phone call from the same advisor that the engineer cannot come today.
I am disabled and cannot get out the house and I'm sitting here cold with no hot water and a damaged kitchen ceiling.
And i cannot use the light switch.

I would Give 0 star if I could!
This company is absolutely dreadful! do not use them.
They take as much money from you as possible, and they do not care. Customer service is awful (you get spoken to like a 2 year old) and when you have a concern they are just bothered about taking a payment from you.

The worst service i have ever had in my lifetime, as someone said previously I had to give a 1 star as zero stars is not an option. Do not take out a policy with these people. The last 2 years have been terrible despite me being with british gas and homecare for 20 years. several late notice cancelled appointments, taking time off work, staying in all day and nobody turning up. They do not care about the customer.

call a local engineer if you have trouble, BG will take days to arrive from point of call, i will call a local company and keep a receipt of repairs and send it to BG.
not once during the call did they ask about persons in the house if they had any ailment, were there any young, was any elderly in the property.
if a boiler is down is it not clear no heating or hot water is available. BG doesnt care, questions are all just covid related now once you pass the security questions.....

Had appt booked for 3weeks in advance .Day before APPT BG rang to say they were moving it on a week to which I went berserk!!
They agreed to keep to original appt time and when engineer arrived (a contracted private engineer not working for BG)he was so inexperienced( his words not mine)he couldnt deal with it and referred us back to BG.!
So sick of BG now .This isnt a service with peace of mind anymore.When contract is due for renewal I'm going with another company  who can get their engineers out within a couple of days and get excellent reviews.
BG is a sinking ship in my opinion.!

We have had a British Gas boiler care contract for many years but yesterday, 14 December, when we needed an engineer as we had no hot water or heating, we were told the first available appointment was 4 January.
We are both elderly so it is ridiculous to expect us to go that length of time without heating and hot water in the middle of winter.
We have been forced to find a private engineer at a high cost.
Absolutely disgusted with their service.

At 4.30am we realised that water was coming through the loft hatch, we called British Gas who finally attended our home at 12 noon (some 24 hour emergency service that is!) He informed us that the contractor that British Gas sent to our home 2 months ago completely bodged the job of replacing the safety release valve on our boiler. He clearly could not get it in properly so wedged it in place with a piece of sawn off pipe, image below. This was an accident waiting to happen, all confirmed by a British Gas own engineer. Because of his incompetence I have a ruined carpet and water damage to 4 rooms. Despite two calls to your team requesting help (including an electrical safety check) no one has fulfilled the promised call back. I am simply aghast at this disgraceful attitude, I am sure that British Gas would love for my insurance company to pick up the bill for the damage and for I to pay through the nose for years afterwards for daring to claim. This is completely down to you so do the right thing and contact us, a ‚Äúplease message us‚Äù standard response is unacceptable, do the right thing otherwise I will see you in court!

I am now left trying to find someone else to repair with less than 2 weeks to Christmas. I hope you will enjoy your Christmas Dinner as I doubt we will be having one.

First our annual boiler service was cancelled on the day it was due to be carried out and a new appointment made over three weeks later which was kept.

A problem with the boiler which was due to be fixed as part of the annual service did not resolve the problem. Arranged foe a service call. given a date over three weeks away. On day of appointment contacted by British Gas who cancelled the appointment and made another one, yet again over tree weeks away.

On day of second appointment British Gas again cancelled and made another appointment almost 4 weeks away.

When my Service contract expires I will not be renewing with British Gas as they seem incapable of keeping an appointment.

In my experience very poor customer service.

Boiler and heating system not functioning properly. Called in Homeserve with whom we were under service contract. After 2 days of ineptness they left us in a worst state as the fitting of a new pump introduced copious amounts of air into the system and a leak left us with a damaged ceiling. Spent the last 4 nights with no heating and no hot water. Called British Gas on Sunday morning, had an engineer with us at 10.00 on Monday morning and by 10:40, the heating system was purring! Committed to spend ¬£300.00 over 12 month for 3 star cover that looks after my complete heating system. Money well spent methinks...absolutely delighted with speed of response, professionalism of engineer and the result. Thank you!

We had a leak inside our Boiler which was first noticed on a Sunday. It is very difficult to contact anyone on a Sunday unless it is a Gas Emergency. However, I did manage to book a Appointment using the Online Booking System for two and a half weeks later! The following Wednesday we noticed the leak was getting worse so I tried the 'Live chat' function and spoke with Prathamesh. He arranged for an Engineer to visit at 8pm that night, the relevant part was ordered and the Engineer came back at 10.30 the following morning and the leak was fixed. Think I was very lucky reading the reviews on here.

I tried to contact them - there is no way I can do this. They cannot be reached. So they are my energy suppliers, will take whatever they want each month, and I can not contact them.

I have had a Homecare agreement for several years. My boiler runs on LPG. A few weeks ago the engineer turned up to carry out the annual service only to discover that we do not use natural gas. He was not qualified to work on LPG boilers. British Gas then contacted me to say the engineer had called but could not gain access. Visit was rebooked for November 29th but engineer failed to turn up. Their customer service is the worst I have encountered in any industry. They are a joke.

Terrible. I needed a simple one off quote that you can't get via the website cos they just want to sell you the monthly packages. 
I tried to call and was instantly put 15th in the queue. After almost an hour I hadn't moved very far so decided to try the live chat on the website, they were close (it was before 4pm?) So redirected me to the WhatsApp chat. 
The whatsapp automated chat asked me the same question 3 times in a row, ignoring each response, then redirected me to the call center. Brilliant. 

Tried again the next day, was in another phone queue and didn't have the whole day to stay on the phone. So tried the live chat via their website again, this time I got through to a person, but it took them 5-10mins to get a reply every time, they explained it was because they were working from home and the systems freezes. 
Each time I asked the same question, for the one off quote I needed, 5-10mins I got an apology for the wait and then another wait, this person didn't simply think to stop apologising and respond to my actual question. Finally after 40plus minutes of the text chat I was quoted ¬£150, which I had paid ¬£45+vat last year with British gas, I expected the price to have gone up, but not that much, so I questioned it. I was advised there was no discounts, but I could sign up to their monthly scheme which would get the job I needed done, plus something I didn't need doing and cost me much more than the ¬£150 I was just quoted. 

I replied I would go elsewhere cos it's the most expensive I've been quoted. 

Next day the WhatsApp message chimes in. Asking me those same questions I'd been previously asked and had answered multiple times. I responded I'd had my quote and gone elsewhere. Then I got an instant reply that the cost of the job would be ¬£95. Not what I was quoted yesterday, but still one of the most expensive quotes I'd received. Again I said I'd booked with another company. The WhatsApp chat then continued to send me repeats of the same automated questions over and over again. I've had to block them.

I moved to a new home a couple of months ago. There was a smart meter installed but the display was broken: the touch screen never worked and the device constantly went off-line until one day it just gave up trying to connect, meanwhile constantly beeping. I chatted with a BG customer service person to see if the issue could be resolved. He was completely clueless: he asked me several times to wait while he double-checked information and consulted with colleagues. Initially they refused to do anything because they claimed the device had been installed more than 12 months previously (fact that I could not verify because I've only moved there 2 months ago) and that if I wanted to get it fixed I had to pay for a trader to do it, or I could have the smart meters removed at the cost of ¬£139 for the electric one and ¬£125 for the gas one. After more argie-bargie, they agreed that, because I was a new house owner, they would replace it. The first slot available was one month down the line, which was not ideal but I accepted. A couple of days later I received an email from BG saying that my appointment was cancelled because I did not qualify for a replacement. They asked me to call them if I had issues with that. Unfortunately I'm on a fixed tariff, so I'd have to pay to quit them now, but will definitely do so as soon as feasible and never look back! They are a arrogant bunch. Avoid!

They lie to you non stop and tell you an engineer will be out to fix your metre by 6pm. Please call back if no one turns up. So we did.. Shocker offices are now closed over the weekend. Weve been left for 9 days with no hot water or heating and 2 young children in the property.. one has asthma serverly. We were told we were priority due to this.. I have now been on the phone to a customer 'care' advisor for 2 hours!!! He isnt answering any of my quetions..he keeps putting me on hold whilst im half way through talking. I have asked over 20 times to speak to a manager. He is telling me one isnt available yet I can here her in the background telling him what to say..he has asked me several times why I need to speak with a manager. I have told him 4 different reasons and have said can you answer or resolve those 4 questions.. he has said no.. I have said well there you go then I need to speak with a manager. I will be leaving british gas this afternoon and moving to another company. This company is a joke and should not be allowed to trade. And to top it off.. they have taken ¬£3.60 over 2 days off of our credit amount.. how ???? How when we have had no use of gas ?!!!!

Awful I don't know what I'm paying for gas and electricity they are keeping it a secret they answer the phone you leave them meter reading they don't bill you they say they will massage you they do after 3 days then before you can reply (11 second later)they send another massage to say looks like you don't need our help.

Easily the worst experience I've ever had with a utilities company. I was, for my sins, transferred to BG after People's Energy went bust.

First they didn't set up our account properly so we couldn't login to give a meter reading. We went through the forgot password facility and reset the pass, but it still didn't let us in.

We tried to call, but never got near them. It was always a 30-45 minute wait time - that was if you managed to get through the labiryntine ""press X for Y"" menus that actually led you to a human.

As a supposed alternative we were invited to use their What's App service. This is just another bot-based facility that can, in theory, to those who are very lucky, lead you to chat with an actual human. We waited over 24 hours for a reply; when eventually someone did, they completely missed the fact we'd attached our meter readings to the previous message.

When I pointed this out, it seemed to end the chat, and we were returned to the beginning of the process, with the labiryntine menu system. We never had another message from a human.

Honestly, it's like this company has been designed to frustrate. It's laughable that these cost-saving What's App systems are intended to make things easier and streamlined, yet just lead people to be annoyed and not ultimately get the help they need.

Remember when you could just talk to someone and they'd sort your problem out?

There's probably a reason intelligent extraterrestrials haven't visited earth yet. They look at the likes of Trump, Brexit and British Gas and probably think there's far more intelligent places to visit.

Good job, British Gas!

Simply terrible, they've left my tenants without hot water or heating for a week. There are small children in the house and so I've put them up in a hotel whilst British Gas continue to delay fixing the problem. Worst still, they lie about arriving at the property but no one being there (they do not call me or the tenants to check). It takes too long to speak with someone and when you do they simply don't care. You're better off calling a local provider than using these expensive cowboys. I have numerous properties looked after by another provider and will never use British Gas again.

Was with BG for a number of years.Since May 2021 I have had nothing but problems with my gas and electricity meters.Have spent hours on the phone to them being told a load of lies phone just put down.Told they are not sending engineers out because of covid which was untrue.When the came out fixed flauty meter.Then came back out a few weeks later to put new meters in so could pay DD.Done the electric meter but had problems  with gas meter so put me back on card meter.They cancelled both my DD.Then came back out a month later and put another gas meter in still had credit on old meter which the engineer said they would credit me which her wrote down.Had to set up DD again .Was told They could not set them up as I was a month behind as I had cancelled  them,When it was them.When I did get them set up they took money from my account at different days to what I wanted.Then they said with the last meter They took out with the credit on it that they could not find the paperwork for it.In the end I had enough and I have now gone to another supplier with a cheaper rate then BG.Same on you BG for the way your customer service  treated me and I hope the money which you have not refunded me from my meter puts your profits up more.

Have got Homecare cover. Promises so much but delivers so little. Today (Monday) had water leaking from the boiler. Rang and the automated message said it‚Äôs easy to book an engineer online. Tried, but the first available day was Thursday! After a huge amount of effort, managed to actually talk to someone (they make it really hard for you to do this). They said they would get someone out today before 4:00pm. In the afternoon was told the engineer was on schedule but then got a message to say it was delayed due to an urgent appointment. At 6:15pm got a message saying the engineer was on his way and would be with me shortly. 7:45pm and he still
Hadn‚Äôt turned up. Rang and was told he had to go to an emergency (as if water flooding out of the boiler isn‚Äôt an emergency!) but would be with me before 10:00pm. Needless to say, 10:00pm came and went. Spoke to someone who said they would still be coming as they work 24 hours. I‚Äôm not holding my breath!

Have previously had nothing but praise for BG who have serviced the boiler in my High Street offices for years so god knows what has gone wrong to make them such an awful company now. Didn't know they were as bad as I have discovered by reading all of the following reviews!! Annual Service booked in September, engineer didn't turn up, no contact to say why, to cut a long story short rebooked a further two times and again engineer didn't turn up and again no contact to say why! Spoke to lady who was very nice as she said she dealt with booking the engineers' appointment and one was booked for today and gave her a window of between 9am and 4pm for him to get here. At 3pm no sign of the engineer even though I managed to get through at lunchtime and bookings confirmed engineer would be here mid afternoon guess what for the 4th time no show. Got through on phone and told I was being put through to bookings after hanging on for over 40 minutes I hung up and emailed their Credit Control asking for a refund. I have spoken to this department before and they are good, pity the rest are don't follow suit. Must be something really drastic wrong at BG for them to move from a brilliant company to a complete shower!!

I was switched to British Gas because previous electricity supplier PFP Energy went bust. Since the date of the switchover on 02/11/21 our economy 7 heating has not come on. Freezing cold house for over a week and no resolution in prospect. Due to a number of medical conditions my partner is considered to be extremely vulnerable. So far have made 4 separate phone calls to BG customer service totalling 4.5 hours. I have been lied to , fobbed off , and cut off. These people are totally incompetent. With the last phone call , i thought i was actually getting somewhere and an engineer visit was arranged for today - he never turned up !!!
Their online live chat does'nt work. Their online complaints form does'nt work. There complaints email address is'nt monitored !!! Have tried contacting them through Twitter - so far no reply.

Not willing to help or do anything they basically said they don't care.

Was forced to switch to British gas after my provider when bust. No night supply on day of switch.  Customer service answered after 25 minutes,  spent an hour  trying to convince a person  in South Africa to send an engineer.  He said my smart meter was not supported by BG and exchanged  it 2 days later for an older model. I was without heating and hot water for 3 days because BG can't be bothered to check if they can supply a service.
BTW compared to my previous company BG are charging 
Day rate +100%
Night rate +30%

Last Wednesday our boiler stopped working. I went on the homesrrve site to book an engineer I checked the tick box that said I had no hot water and no heating. The first available appointment was 6 days later. Reluctantly I booked it. No hot water or heating for a family of 5 for a week. Today the engineer was due sometime between 8am and 6pm. All day texts your engineer is on schedule come 6pm no engineer but 6.04pm a call from the help desk. Sorry the engineer was running late he would be there by 8pm. 8pm came and went from 6.04pm till now 9.30pm nothing no call text nothing. Just no engineer. You know tomorrow I will have a fight to get an engineer. Fast to take your money. Slow to do anything else.

Awful experience. Engineer came to service boiler, he incompetently FLOODED THE HOUSE with water leaking through the ceiling lights.

He said he would call on Monday to discuss, he didn't. Didn't leave any paperwork for the service.

Called customer service, they didn't know the engineer had messed up. Finally agreed to send an electrician to check our wet electrics a week later.

I asked for paperwork 3 times, still not received it. Asked for another service as we don't know what has been done and no confidence in the first engineer. This was flatly refused, very poor customer service and gas engineer was very poor.

Boiler service was overdue as they wouldn't let me book it for 2 months initially.

Tried to charge us for electrician visit to fix their problem. They still haven't paid out for the lost time, damaged roof damaged tiles or kitchen units, this could take months. They haven't even offered a refund or someone to fix the damage.

Seriously very badly handled and not worth the money. Other companies are cheaper and offer much, much better customer service.

AVOID!

On the British Gas website  it states Unlimited callouts  I booked a call for a repair to my central heating and had to wait 2 weeks Then on the day before the engineers visit the appointment was cancelled by British gas and re arranged for 15 th November Approximately  30 days from when I initially requested for an engineer to visit 
I would therefore suggest the claim of Unlimited call outs is incorrect and breaks the Consumer Rights act 2015 Put simply if it takes 30 days to attend my property then by no stretch of the imagination can it the said that British Gas provide  unlimited call outs The call outs are limited by there inability to visit my property in a reason able time

Service booked for 29th Oct, first one since April 2020. On the 28th Oct I received an email confirming the appointment for the 29th. At 4pm on the same day I received the email (28th Oct) I had a phone call cancelling the engineers vist the following day. The reason given were emergencies, which I can accept as we all have had these, but when I was told the next appointment I could have was the 28th Dec I was and am furious. There will always be emergencies, so how many times will my next supposed appointment be pushed back due to these? I was inconvenienced taking the time off to be present for the engineers visit and will have to do the same again in Dec, IF the engineer is free enough to get to doing my service or will I get another cancellation at the eleventh hour like recently. I have paid my money and feel cheated and sidelined. Absolutely disgusting, and British Gas are on television advertising Homecare as such a wonderful service they can provide.

I am on emergency credit there is no body to talk to each telephone call lasts at least 1 hour 15 minutes (30 mins of that passed waiting for someone to pick up the phone!) and they often do not resolve the problem.

Worst company and staff I have ever dealt with. Just had an engineer visit and at first he was friendly as we have two boilers and he said the other one might not be covered. He had a 30 second look at our second boiler, and whilst he did, I thought I would be nice and get him a torch. He told me to slow down and stop going so fast, all I was only trying to help. He wasn‚Äôt helping, didn‚Äôt suggest what the problem might be and just acted like he wanted to get out of the house as quick as possible. We have a smart meter that has Not been working for months, numerous calls to be told someone will look into it and told the engineer it‚Äôs not working and he just ignored me as he walked out the house. Then spent the next 5 minutes writing an engineer report to condemn a boiler that he looked at for 30 seconds (I have camera evidence of this) so how the hell can he condemn it in this time when all that wasn‚Äôt working was the pilot light would not come on. Actually, I realise now after speaking to other people that this is a common occurrence and all they are looking to do is get you to spend ¬£10k on a new boiler that could be installed by much more professional people for half that cost.

British Gas Homeserve -toxic - steer clear

Have been with British Gas Homeserve for 10 years and they used to be ok. However, they don‚Äôt now have enough engineers to provide anything other than emergency cover for total breakdowns during the winter, when you are most likely to need them. After they missed a number of appointments, I found they if you wish to raise a formal complaint you have to write to them, as they don‚Äôt respond to emails. Laughably they refer you to their Twitter or Facebook accounts. I shall be terminating my contract and would advise anyone to steer clear of this disastrous company.

My boiler has broken and I have no hot water and so booked an engineer through British Gas Homecare. The first appointment was booked for a Thursday from 08:00 to 18:00 and I waited in all day but the engineer did not show up. I then booked another appointment for Tuesday the following week between 12:00 to 18:00 and the engineer did show up at 11:15. He said he needed to order a part for my boiler and that he would fit it in the afternoon of the following day. I rushed back from visiting my elderly parents in the morning so that I would be able to meet the appointment. Without warning the appointment was cancelled and re-booked for the following day. Again I waited in all day but the engineer did not show up. I then phoned the helpline and was on hold for 42 minutes. When I eventually spoke to someone they agreed there had been an issue and that they would try to arrange for the engineer to come and fit the part. Several days later and I still have not heard anything so I tried to re-book an engineer appointment but again no engineer came and my online appointment disappeared. Hopeless...

I took the service homecare plan out on the 10 October to cover the heating and boiler .I was told they gave me electrics and all drains and pipe work.after 7 days my shower started leaking the man came out the next day took one look and said he didn't have time to do the job and to call the company to rebook another appointment .When I called they told me I wasn't covered due to the shower not being fitted correctly.I called British gas and was told the same ,they took my money and because the job was more than a hour they made this lame excuse and said they would register my complaint but this won't get my disabled wife and daughter a shower .what a load of rubbish how can they make a contract on to not fulfill there obligations.

After a dispute with BG regarding confusing and unclear billing , received threats of extra charges and debt collectors. The billing mess was TOTALLY BG problem. So I made a complaint and was told to IGNORE the threats.  After 5 weeks of NOT agreeing with the so called BG customer service and pushing hard to make my point about the bullying tactics that BG use , I paid my final Bill with agreement by the lady that had been trying to COPE with obviously , a huge number of complaints. Final Bill paid , complaint 'resolved' .... and then the Debt collection Agency letter arrives.  Bloody JOKE is BG. Hopeless.

My Energy supplier went bust ,so o ofgem switched me to British Gas and on the 30/09/21 opted to go on a cheaper tariff Fixed price August 22v2 and was told it would take 7 days to change over , 15 days went by and I complained only to find out that I couldn't have this tariff even though it had been agreed by live chat to which I have a copy of the transcript , during my complaint I was offered another tariff and compensation of ¬£20 I initially excepted as long there were no strings attached but because I would not drop my complaint as punishment the tariff was taken off the table. To finish none of this is my fault and after 16 days I want to leave this nightmare behind and have emailed Neon Reef a supplier I used to be with and it's a bit more expensive but there customer service is so much better than what I have experienced and I fully intend to go the ombudsman. Avoid this company. Regards , Mr Dawson very unhappy customer.

I CAN'T BELIEVE BG STILL HAS ANY CUSTOMERS !!!!                   I have had my usually perfect credit rating wrecked by British gas's incompetence. I have written to them. Phoned them. Tried to pay a bill from beginning of 2020 but they said I owed nothing. After spending hours on the phone over several months. They finally found the bill which was for a previous address. So I paid it. I asked their final debt department to have the adverse credit entry removed. But they said I owed nothing and the previous agent should not have taken payment and they would refund me!!! I am now waiting for written confirmation but as usual no record has been emailed or texted as promised.

When this energy crisis is over I will be switching to a company that actually values it loyal customers, something British Gas doesn't.

Taken out homecare for a annual boiler service for ¬£90 by direct debit online and changed my mind 1 week later well within the cooling off period of 2 weeks to cancel without charge, then trying to cancel the direct debit by ringing british gas waiting on phone for upto 1 hour without them answering and when they did answer once he had taken my details and i said about cancelling then the british gas guy said he is just opening his laptop and then he put me on hold and did not answer again after waiting another half an hour.
Went to natwest bank and they said we cannot cancel direct debits and you have to contact british gas for them to cancel the direct debit.
Still cannot get them to answer the phone despite waiting upto 1 hour.
In the options when you ring and say cancel direct debit, nobody ever answers, but if i say ""new boiler"" it easily books you a date.
The reason i cancelled the direct debit is to book an annual service it would take at least 7 weeks to visit me and when they contacted me they wanted to visit me to quote me for a new boiler instead and could visit me in days.
Absolute joke this is and cannot believe british gas are getting away with this.
Still is ongoing as of 14-10-21

Engineer to sort out Smart Meter Monitor was supposed to come today.  As a resolution between myself and British Gas because they did not turn up on 11 October 2021, this appointment was fixed yesterday, confirmed by Aiyesha who checked with planning who also confirmed it with Aiyesha for today between 1 pm and 5 pm.  This surely shows that British Gas are incompetent at the provision of customer service and their promises are fruitless!  I checked my account and there was no indication of any engineer's visit today and no way of tracking the engineer.  As all British Gas customers should be aware, getting through to a human on the telephone is rather challenging and hopeless.  I tried to call at 4:40 pm and was told there was around a 20 minute wait which basically means that my call would not be answered as British Gas seems to close telephone lines at 5 pm and customers would either be cut off or go around in circuit for hours and hours and nobody would answer.  Sorry Aiyesha, whilst you are in the Smart Meters Team, as I was let down yet again (which has become rather repetitive), my feedback is ZERO.  I do not do Facebook or Twitter so please do not ask me to contact you using that method.  Kindly have the courtesy to email me.  Again,  I have had to take half a day off work for the NHS and, again, British Gas has misled and failed the customer.  Well done in your appalling customer service British Gas!

I had arranged to have a Gas Smart Meter and Smart monitors for both gas and electricity installed for 11 October 2021.  I have been waiting weeks for the engineer.  For some reason, British Gas decided to change my contact details and state a number which I have never had or know of.  I have spent an inordinate amount of time today and took the time off work with the NHS to be at home.  I eventually managed to get through and was told that the engineer could not be contacted by phone and the appointment would have to be changed if the engineer did not pick up.  How dare British Gas to change my contact number without permission!!!! I am so frustrated with the service of British Gas and communication with British Gas - it is absolutely appalling!!! so much time has been wasted dealing with them!!!

L had an agreed DD for ¬£33-85 and without any notification British gas took ¬£200-73 .  After disputing this amount ¬£224-38 was refunded. The following month another ¬£220-73 was removed from my account.    After waiting on the phone and having it hung up on me twice I was told that they couldn't see there was a problem. I survive on a very small pension and I live in a small 1 bedroom flat.  I raised 2 complaints and was assured that someone would contact me  They never have. I have since changed my utilities supplier.

Each time an appointment is made it gets cancelled. BG rang me to make an appointment for someone to service it in September and two day's later I had a missed call, when I rang the number bk the automated voice said it wasn't anything to worry about and no need to get in touch so I didn't. The day the service was arrange for no one came, when I rang they said I had cancelled it!! I'm waiting for someone to ring me now about my complaint.

A typical ex-nationalised 'untouchable' company operating fraudulently.
British Gas hoodwinked my restaurant staff in Nov 2018 to 'fix' the smart meter to work on MAXDEMAND tariff which means a minimum bill is issued irrespective of actual usage. Bills went from ¬£111 to ¬£1505 monthly which forced closure of this small restaurant. Knowledge of MAXDEMAND tariff did not come about until 2021. BG offered no such contract nor explanation nor willingness to resolve.
If this was not true, I would be sued. British Gas are definitely NOT RECOMMENDED as business suppliers.
For 3 years British Gas have refused to justify or correct (several complaints raised & Ombudsman refused to investigate claiming Smart Meters are enforced by law but there is no legislation for lack of mobile signal/defaulting to maximum usage bills) their [default/estimated] overcharged bills until the posting of online reviews. Now (10/21), overcharged by ¬£20k I am forced to take BGB to court for ¬£19k refund & loss of profit: unlikely to get more than refund so AVOID! Simply cannot do worse.
Additionally, BG have unwarrantedly damaged my credit rating.

Organised an appointment for an engineer for an annual service on my boiler and he cancelled due to a home emergency (ironic). Rescheduled and this time the engineer didn't even bother to turn up or call the explain.  Have made a third appointment in two weeks now to see if this time they appear. The customer service is APPALLING! It's actually quite funny how bad it is, only one operator on the chat (Sachin -- don't call as it's bots who guide you to nothing except the opportunity to hang up on you) was any good. Overall, British Gas are not good for what they used to be the Rolls Royce of - servicing boilers. I'm sure there are plenty of others who are happy to help, especially smaller, local firms who would be keen to step in where  British Gas can't be bothered to tread. Let's see

Absolute rip off...
I've cancelled my contract as I was moving homes and didn't want to carry on with this provider.  Before cancelling, I checked my account and my account was on credit for both electricity and gas.  Surprise, surprise, when I cancelled and gave them my meter reading, I received a combined bill of ¬£270!  In other words, they can do what they want and you have not options.  There are much better / cheaper providers out there.  I've moved to Bulb and so far, I am happy with their services.

British Gas has over the last 2 months been the obsolute worse to deal with. Their server had gone down which had forced our meter to disconnect from their server not sending readings. Nearly a year went by and no one had informed us of anything, until we got a ¬£300 bill. Once this was explained to us (7 phone calls in) we agreed we owed the money and would like 1 simple request before paying, a list of our monthly usage so we can confirm the amount. Yet here we stand with no monthly usage sent, around 18 phone calls and an outstanding bill. We were ensured by their agents no one would take action against us while we sort this out, yet we have 5 outstanding compliants, no one calls us back, letters saying we will be passed to debt collection and it just seems british gas would rather have their money than help their customers with their customer service. If your reading this review, go to someone else for your services! 

British Gas, feel free to reach me if you would like to sort this out.

Trying to obtain money‚Äôs though fraudulent means...
I feel I have to write this review as everyone should realise the seriousness of what this company keep doing to people (I myself included) I recently left them on the 24th of August as I always felt my bills was way to high (every 3 months my bills would come to about ¬£250) and I‚Äôm 1 person living in a 1 bedroom flat . I hardly use anything . Just a tv and very really use anything else (my previous bills with another company was only ¬£80 for the 3 months) big difference to what British Gas are changing ! So I was made to join British Gas due to my other energy supplier went into liquidation. So I was forced into having these rob dogging scamming Con men as my supplier . So I just left them on the 24th of august and they sent me a bill (dated from the 2nd of July until the 23rd of august of ¬£120) I know my bill should be only ¬£20 and I phoned them up to tell them they got it wrong .. well after many dropped phone calls (people just hanging up on you) and people being rude and shouting down the phone I finally talk to someone of polite manner . Who did confirm that my last bill with them (as I found a better supplier) would be only ¬£20 (not ¬£120) well I paid the ¬£20 and thought nothing more of it , then today I go to check my account to finally see an end account balance that should only be ¬£0 well to my utter surprise and astonishment my account balance was ¬£3064.59p !!! Yes you read that right over ¬£3000 !!! Well you can imagine how that must make someone feel . I rang them up (to have the phone put down on me 3 times again without even a word spoken) to finally get through to someone who said a manager would phone me back before 5pm end of business .. well guess what !!! No 1 did phone me . So now I‚Äôm left waiting another day to sort this out .. all this happening while my elderly mother is poorly in hospital and this is hanging over me the thought they are wanting ¬£3000 out of me when I have evidence I sent them full payment for my final bill (of ¬£20) , this is unbelievable! they must get cheap thrills out of frightening people half to death with ludicrous bills they are sending to people .. I dread to think how they treat the elderly and the vulnerable , I bet on days they have a bored meetings I can just imagine them all sitting around a table like Frankenstein and Dracula wondering what ways they can suck the life blood out of more people , people like this should be publicly ashamed and have rotten vegetables thrown at them . The way they have made me feel is physically sick and I won‚Äôt let this drop . ¬£3064.59p !!! They can go and whistle for it .

I rarely complain but this company has honestly been the worst I have ever encountered. They billed me for something that actually I already paid. When I tried to contact them about it back in July they said they would deal with it and indeed it was their mistake. Then I received a text message weeks later saying I did not pay a bill and it will go to debt collection. I then phoned them again on top of writing on their live chat with an agent. I was then told they apologised and see will be fixed right away. Today I have received again same message with the debt collection and on live chat they made me wait 3 hours on chat and passed me to 7 'specialists' to then ignore my messages. This has honestly been the worst customer service and overhaul worst company I have ever dealt with. Thank god I do not treat my clients this way!!

Having received another automated threatening letter despite proactively registering account as new occupier. My experience both last week and today has been one of high incompetence. The tone and demeanour of the call handler was infuriating and disrespectful, add to the fact I have been told twice today that she didn't register us despite spending close to an hour with her last week. I'm still waiting to speak to someone and pay my bill. I will leave British Gas as a consequence of their lack of ability, customer service and the ability to handle and receive or in fact answer calls. The automated processes which I reluctantly followed failed. Highly infuriated of the impact to me and will log a complaint with Ombudsman. AVOID BRITISH GAS at all costs!

Absolutely diabolical sham of a company. Shouldn't be allowed to call themselves British Gas as most of their agents are overseas. I finally got out a few months ago after having issues with them for 2 years or so. Truly don't care about their customers. Web chat is basically non exsistant,although the company use this as one of their methods of asking customers to get in touch. Email complaints not monitored blaming Covid. Other companies are managing to get back on track. The phone system is a joke. Agents hanging up when they not able to deal with complaints. Promises to call back but rarely do. Obviously BG get in touch when they are owed money.
Just cannot describe how I felt when I needed to speak to them and no way possible. Reading reviews on here are shocking. BG should be taken to court and taken to the cleaners. Im now with üêô Energy and they are amazing. Fabulous, caring and delightful advisors. BG agents basically are not trained enough to deal with complaints. Maybe they should employ their agents from this country to help with unemployment. But no, its much cheaper to use overseas staff. What a joke of a company. Would put 0* stars if was able too. AVOID.

The worst experience I've ever had. I suffer from a chronic illness and I find it hard to deal with phone calls and emails also . I requested last year to receive paper statements and if someone could do my meter readings neither happened. Couple of weeks ago my amount taken from British gas went from ¬£120 to ¬£200 without warning , I've had to give up work due to my health so money is very tight ! I spoke to multiple people for hrs over the phone I managed to get a refund from my bank as advised by British gas and to cancel my direct debit and to start it again after a week. To then have British gas take another ¬£200 without a direct debit ! When I called about it I was told a manager would call me back within 2 hrs this has not happened and surely illegal? I feel completely let down and offered no help from this company at all even though they said they would , they say they are there to help people even on the message when you call , but they don't , they don't care what trouble people get in they just want all the money they can get.This has caused me alot of stress and upset not just from the money amount but from the shocking costumer care. DO NOT go with company !

If I could review as zero stars I would, without a doubt the worst service I have ever received from a company, if considering joining, simply don't bother, in the 6 months I was with British gas, I was given 3 separate smart meter slots that were all cancelled 2 the day before and one of which I wasn't even informed of, I was left without gas in the property for a period of 48 hours due to an error and from BG and incorrect information.

The complaints I raised were not originally logged and when they finally were, were not dealt with correctly I'm still waiting to receive acknowledgement of 1 complaint some 4 months on.

It takes circa 45 mins to get through to anybody in the servicing team and when you do their call centre is based in South Africa where if I'm honest nobody has a clue what they are doing, I've been hung up on countless times, given incorrect information countless times, promised something that ultimately I'm told is not possible on a subsequent call countless times and still 3 months later awaiting compensation owed from another complaint.

As initially set out, awful customer service, terribly run and would avoid at all costs don't consider based on their so-called reputable name you will be extremely disappointed.

Hope you find this helpful!

Like many people, we have now had our annual boiler service appointment cancelled yet again -  for the third time. A fourth appointment has apparently been booked. If this fourth appointment does actually happen the service will be c.8 months late....however, I am assuming this 4th appointment will also be cancelled (either on the day...or perhaps no-one will bother to let me know). One gets the feeling (unsubstantiated I have to say) that the poor employees are being pressured to be deliberately misleading and disingenuous with customers about the reasons for this appointment chaos. But they are still taking the monthly direct debit, of course. Will people receive refunds for the money BG continue to take, whilst not being able to provide a service in return? Or compensation for the long term negative effect of a late (or non existent) service to a boiler?

Avoid at all costs. I have a small care home and we had a new Boiler fitted by British Gas and took out a service plan. 

We called them out for a service and they condemned their own 2 year boiler and cut it off. 

Our residents all over 85 years old had no hot water. I called them numerous times to come sort out the problem. I complained now over 4 weeks ago. No one has bothers to reply to my complaint or call me. I posted on Twitter and Facebook. I get a message to PM them.

Dear British Gas,
 
In July of this year, I had become so distressed with the constant calls from your overseas customer representatives I decided I could not cope with the amount of harassment they were causing me.  To give one example, they called me over a dozen times after me hanging up asking them not to call back.  For this reason, I tried to use energy provider that does not call me using a comparison service
 
I then learned I am in a fixed contract until July next year with yourselves.  I specifically and again on multiple occasions, explained I understood this and that I would be moving energy provider as soon as my contract ended.
 
I have raised a complaint over the phone with yourselves yesterday and it was explained the issue lies with a third-party agent Bionic Services Ltd.  I do not believe this is accurate.
 
My personal information has been passed to an agent, without my consent.  This is illegal.
 
Please can you confirm that you can ask any agent that my information has been passed to, to be destroyed.  I am told by yourselves that it is not your responsibility as the agent is the entity that is contacting me, however they are contacting on your behalf ‚Äì therefore it is your responsibility to stop the harassment.
 
As I explained to the customer service representative yesterday, if the harassment continues, I will take this matter further.
 
Regards,
 
Tobias

I have had homecare for years. British gas are trying everything to sell me a new boiler and a powerflush rather than fix the issue. Apparently they don't replace heat exchangers on their contract but there is nothing to this effect in the contract I have with them. There is an exclusion about sludge/limescale if they have previously told you about the issue - in my case they hadn't (boiler serviced for years with them) but they are still leaving us without hot water

I am devastated I have wasted so much money and time with this company. They don't care if you have no hot water or heating, they don't want to do their duty

Also an engineer (John Oxley) was incredibly condescending to me (a woman), but not my flatmate (a man). He continuously talked over me, told me to listen whilst I was talking and used his mask as an excuse for his rudeness.

Also he has done nothing at our visit which we have waiter 5 days for - he has not taken the heat exchanger off, not cleaned it and he left us without hot water. Instead I got a call to get a new boiler in from the installation team - I did not ask for that!!

I am so upset, tired - and have no hot water

British Gas sent their attack dogs Avarto to our business property to issue a notice of disconnection for an invoice we had paid 9 months earlier but they hadn't allocated properly. I wrote a formal complaint letter which they eventually acknowledged and stopped the action. It turns out that at the end of their internal investigation that they owe us 2p, well done British Gas. Another scam they work is to send out their invoices late so they arrive around the due date. They then stick on a late payment charge of ¬£45.00 onto your next invoice just as a little bonus to themselves. What a great company they are certainly NOT. We are now moving all of our accounts away from them and I hope they rot away completely going bust and putting all their rotten staff out of work.

A typical ex-nationalised 'untouchable' company operating fraudulently.
British Gas hoodwinked my restaurant staff in Nov 2018 to 'fix' the smart meter to work on MAXDEMAND tariff which means a minimum bill is issued irrespective of actual usage. Bills went from ¬£111 to ¬£1505 monthly which forced closure of this small restaurant. Knowledge of MAXDEMAND tariff did not come about until 2021. BG offered no such contract nor explanation nor willingness to resolve.
If this was not true, I would be sued. British Gas are definitely NOT RECOMMENDED as business suppliers.
For 3 years British Gas have refused to justify or correct (several complaints raised & Ombudsman refused to investigate claiming Smart Meters are allowed by law but there is no legislation for lack of mobile signal/defaulting to maximum usage bills) their overcharged bills until the posting of online reviews.

I had a direct debit of ¬£33-85.  Without warning of notification British gas took ¬£200-73 out of my bank.  I phoned and queried and ¬£224-38 was returned to my 
bank.  I was told this wouldn't happen again.  Well it did. The following month another¬£200-73 was removed from my bank.  I do have a smart meter, and am a priority customer.  I also survive on a pension of ¬£582-00 a month.  To take out 6 times the agreed monthly amount on 2 separate occasions without notification or warning is tantamount to theft.

The following is an email I have sent today to british gas complaints dept. Imagine my frustration after taking the time to write this, on my first day off in I don't know how long, only to receive an email in return stating that this  email address is unmonitored!

I then proceeded to call them, expecting the usual waiting time of at least half an hour, was surprised when the phone was answered in 10 mins.  proceeded to explain the situation to the operator and ask why i was being sent a warrant letter, when the amount quoted was in dispute and being investigated?  She then told me she would have to speak to her manager and a minute later I was cut off.  I then received a call from different Brutish Gas (yes the pun is intended) number but the call ended after only 2 rings before i could answer it.  I rung back only to have an automated voice tell me that i could manage my British Gas account online!!  read the email i sent below and make up your own minds....they are nothing but bandits!!

now back on the phone to the number i first called, not really expecting anything to be resolved today, in which case, court it is....

I am writing to formally complain about the above British Gas account (account number - (*******) and how it has been (mis) managed by British Gas.  

I was a previous customer of Ebico and when they ceased trading, my account was transferred to British Gas.  I had no problem with this, until I received my first bill, requesting ¬£168.65 on top of my electricity usage, with no explanation of what the ¬£168.65 was for.  

I tried (more than once) to call British Gas to query this, however, did not have time to be kept on hold for up to 45 minutes, whilst trying to get ready for work. 

British Gas then escalated this account to Arvato, who kept calling me on my mobile whilst at work (therefore unable to answer) and sending me text messages (whilst at work).  These texts contained a link to click on, and as I am aware (as are many others) to not click on a link sent in a text, as it is usually scammers, these were ignored, as when i googled the number, it seemed to confirm that they were indeed scammers.

However, this has now escalated into Arvato twice trying to enter my home illegally, once on the 20/07/21, trying to open my door by turning my door handle and again on the 27/07/21 by putting a hand through my letter box to reach my keys which were hanging in the door lock adjacent to the letter box. (Note the ""field agent"" was not putting a letter through my letter box, as his hand went toward my keys, withdrew and a few minutes later, presumably the time it took to fill in his handwritten form/letter, then put letter through my letterbox).

I would like to know exactly what these ""field agents"" planned to do had they gained access to my home, considering there had been no warning that they were coming and considering the fact that upon there second visit, i had just come out of the shower and was wrapped in nothing but a towel?  Were they planning on taking my belongings had I not been at home?  Also, considering from my point of view at the time, had my door not been locked, from my point of view at the time, I would have had a strange/unknown male in my property whilst wrapped in nothing but a towel, putting me in a very vulnerable position.

Further, upon then calling British Gas, again whilst trying to get ready for work and kept on hold for a considerable amount of time (at one point being 23rd in the queue), and after having to book a taxi to work, so I could possibly sort this out, I am answered by one of your operators, who to say she was incompetent and condescending is an understatement.  Upon my informing her that i want to query the above mentioned ¬£165.68, she then immediately proceeded to ask me if I want to set up a direct debit.  I understand that your operators have a script to adhere to and targets to reach, however, surely the basic training of good customer relations is actually listening to what the customer is saying, something she seemed completely unable or unwilling to do, as she then proceeded to talk so fast that I actually had to ask her to slow down, as i couldn't understand a work she was saying and literally could not get a word in, until I myself became louder in an effort to be heard, to which her attitude became very condescending. Overall , I found her very rude, obviously couldn't get off the phone quick enough and just generally gave the impression she didn't want to help, although she did grudgingly say she would she would escalate this to ""an investigation"", after I stated to her that I do not owe money from my previous supplier, as when British Gas took over the account, I was ¬£6 in credit with Ebico. ( I have an email from them stating this).

Can you please confirm that this account is actually being investigated and forward me the case number for this please?  I would also like a complete breakdown of what this ¬£168 is for, as all your operator could tell me was that it was it was carried over from my previous supplier and as stated above, that account was ¬£6 in credit.

Further, I also called Arvato on the same day, stating this amount is being disputed/under investigation, and wishing to complain about the actions of their field agents, and they are still calling me at work.  WHY?   I believe this now constitutes harassment.  Arvato have also stated to me that they cannot contact me my preferred method (email), which I believe they are legally obliged to do.

I would like an update regarding the complaint i made to Arvato on the 27/07/21 please.

Which takes me to today, having received a letter from Scottish Gas, stating that that a warrant is about to be applied for to enter my home.  Why am i being threatened with a warrant, when the account is being disputed?  It is my understanding that this is not protocol, if an account/amount due is under dispute.  However, if you wish to continue with this, I will quite happily attend court to explain all of the above and contest the warrant or instruct a solicitor to do so on my behalf if I am unable to take a day off work.  ( I am sure that the judge would be interested in hearing how you and your ""field agents"" are harassing/threatening and trying to illegally enter the home of an NHS worker, who has reasonably tried to resolve this issue.

Finally, I would like all communication with myself, regarding this matter to be via email, as I am often unable to answer the phone and often do not receive mail due to it frequently going missing, as I have previously stated to Arvato.

Regards,

Suzann Chalmers

These comedians employ transhumans with zero common sense, ability to think outside the box or empathy. Never ever use these morons for your gas and electric supply.

(A) The wait time is always much longer than what is stated at the outset.
(B) The agents' comprehension of the English language is about as competent as that of a sterilised parrot.
(C) They answer questions that you did not ask whilst obfuscating the answers to others.
(D) They don't apologise for having made you wait.
(E) Before answering your query they ask a plethora of questions, by which the time the customer is suffering from hypothermia.
(F) Some of the agents mince their words. They need to visit a speech therapist.
(G) The imbeciles give you conflicting information and have no shame about it.
(H) They were all selected as employees from the abortion bucket - the cast offs of life.

Had a letter from BG this morning my gas bill has risen 3 times in the past 4 months hence we live in a 2 bed flat and do not cook by gas.I got through to someone from the home moving team he was pleasant and helpful and I was on the phone for 53 mins.He said it was to do with my tariff  he maged get me  ¬£4.50 p of my monthly payment.I explained to him about the two years of hell and grief we've had with BG so he did a complaint for me.we even did a mutual exchange and BG had the nerve to bill us for our address even though we had signed contract of the date of the exchange when i called them about  it they said it was  owed from when we lived there what a load of liars we've got the letters they clearly state the dates and  months they were billing us for and we were nit living there.We even had grief with out electric our meter is flashing a red light BG say they ran  a check on our meter and there is nothing wrong with it we live In  2 bed felt not a 14 bedroom mansion.A petition needs to be set up and BG need Invstigsting by the government they shouldn't be allowed to do to people what they do.There are some nice helpful Caller handlers but the bad ones outweigh the good especially in the Billing department.Keep all emails and letters form BG.If you are considering switching to BG think about it carefully this company is a serious risk to your mental well being we even dread the post coming now and seeing.g a letter from them as you don't know what being thrown at u next.Think twice if you are considering switching to BG.Tha.nx to them swapping and changing our monthly payment like the weather we  now have a debt with them so are stuck with them at the moment avoid them at all costs.The message at the top when.ylu write ur compaint say sorry to hear you had a bad experience with BG this company isn't sorry at all.

Heres my experience, I was getting monthly estimated bills for my electricity, I couldn't ever get in touch to give a meter reading nor was I ever prompted too but it didn't bother me too much until I started getting silly money taken from my bank every month due to British Gas's 'estimations'. I decided to leave and go with another energy provider, British Gas got my final meter reading and for have sent me a bill of ¬£540 for the period of 17th May - 17th June. ¬£540 for a month! I live in a 3 bed terraced house not Michael Jackson's Neverland mansion! I contacted BG to be told they have got it wrong and they will send me the correct bill around 14 days later, 6 days later I get another bill for the exact same amount only this time telling me I have until 20th July to pay it. I contacted BG and was told the bill is correct and they had 'undercharged me' the month before (they have been charging me ¬£45 a month, my new provider took my meter readings which showed that I use around ¬£30 worth of electricity a month, oh, also im currently using ¬£17 gas a month and BG was charging me ¬£40 in the height of summer). I made a complaint to BG and asked for the outstanding balance to be put on hold until a complaints handler contacts me, I woke up this morning to find my credit score, which I have worked hard to maintain, has dropped below fair (it was a really good score and I have never missed a payment with BG)  because there is now an unpaid mark from British Gas against my score now. Even though the payment was not even due for anther 5 days. Thanks British Gas im trying to get a mortgage which is hard enough already, bt thank you for dropping my  credit score and having me crying for the past week! Guys please don't join British Gas, this is what they do to you when you try to leave!!

Where to start? First of all the customer experience via the App and website are beyond terrible.
The App is barely functional most of the time and for long periods of time just doesn't work at all.

The website is disjointed and a mess to navigate as well as extremely slow.

Then once I finally left, I settled any outstanding payment yet they still kept taking money from me. I logged a complaint and asked for email contact so ofcourse they called and text me.

If you want to know why you do soo poorly in reviews its experiences like this.

I will now actively avoid BG for foreseeable future.

I have been a loyal customer for over 45 years yet pay for service at a higher level than a new customer.

Needed a repair visit and had to wait three weeks. The day before I get a call cancelling the visit because they have no engineer available in the area and offered a visit nearly three weeks later. Six weeks in all. Even then a new part will probably be needed so yet further delay.
Totally unacceptable.

The person who called me was difficult to understand his accent and had the wrong idea about the problem even though I had spelled it out in detail when booking on line.

All these cuddly ""we will look after you "" ads on TV are so much bunkum.

I have had a reply from Maria at BG telling me they only reschedule if there's an emergency. Thats not what they told me when they phoned to cancel. It was they had no engineers available.

Anyway that's not the point, which is as the cancellation was their fault I should get a priority reschedule not another 18 days as if it was a new service request. (which shouldn't be that long anyway)

I switched to Brit Gas Economy 7 (dual-rate) tariff in Feb 2021. 

When Covid19 restrictions were lifted, I booked the smart meter install prompted by a text message. 

The engineer came today and was about to install a ""single-rate"" smart meter. I politely declined the install when he explained that my tariff would change as a result of the install. 

When I phoned the contact centre, they said I'm not getting any benefits from dual-rate electricty and that I will be fine with the single rate tariff but she wouldn‚Äôt get me any new figures when I said ""prove it"". She said that the smart meter team dont do the calculations, so she had to pass me to the Tariff team.

The agent on the Tariff team said my kWh charges would go from:

Day: 16.862p/kWh ; and
Night: 11.279p/kWh

To a single flat rate of:

23.860p/kWh !!

Now, I'm no maths whiz, but that is NOT the same or cheaper!!

British Gas are operating like a bunch of scammers. A Smart Meter should not involve a tariff change. If it does - customers should be told very very clearly. 

Treating Customers Fairly ? I don‚Äôt think so :-(

Never trust British Gas with DD
For the love of God never trust them with DD. They took ¬£2,100 out of account and when I asked them about it in May 2021, they said that this is estimated bill and that I will get a refund of ¬£1300 within next three to five working days. it is 09/07/2021 and I am still getting the same answer from them each week. No money from them so far.

I wish I could give one star also. After months of back and forth trying to get an incorrect meter reading sorted, I left British Gas because of their overwhelming incompetence. Eon are so much easier to deal with by comparison. 

They owe me over 500 pounds and it's like trying to get blood out of a stone. Am resigned to sending them one complaint a day until I can go to the energy ombudsmen about them.

I have been advised that there are no parts for my combiboiler if it breaks down and the same for my radiators as they are too old. Homecare gave me a quote but I found out another company much cheaper and decided to cancel my agreement with homecare.
After removing the radiators, the new company said there was no need for them to be replaced as there was no sludge on the pipes or radiators. Homecare advised that there was sludge on them and on the pipes. The cost for a one off power flush would be ¬£950. 
Phoned homecare to cancel my agreement, I was advised that my annual seria de for the period of 2021-2022 was not done and I was not due any more payment and that my direct debit on the 1st was not going to be collected. After 2:30 hours trying to contact customer service I was told that I was i was due a payment of the previous month. Customer service adviser on web chat left the chat after asking what the problem was. 
I‚Äôve had previous problems with plumbing not turning up when had blocked pipes.
Homecare are not reliable and they are getting much worst by not giving the right information to customers. I feel that homecare lied saying that my combiboiler and radiators have no parts if required so they can sell their products that is much more expensive (even with discount) that other suppliers.

I don't even want to give it one star but had no choice.
I have been a Homecare customer for many years, however after yesterday's experience 29/06/22 I am now going to go else where.
The engineer that came to my home to service the boiler was rude irate and had a bad attitude, in the end I just told him to do his job and leave my home. He said jobs done and went to leave I asked him for a job sheet he said I will get you one he came back from his van and said get someone else to service your boiler, I then said I will be putting in a complain about you he snapped back yes I will be putting complain in about you.
I never felt so nervous around anyone like I did with him he just didn't want to be there which was obvious by his attitude towards me.
I made a complaint and his manager rang me today.
Even though he was very apologetic towards what had happened I felt as though I was not believe after I said with his attitude im surprised you not had other complaints about this engineer he said I have known this person for many years not had any complains about him so basically I felt like a liar and that my complaint was merely to received compensation as I did say to manager what will be the outcome of this.
I honestly think if I had been a man he would not have spoken to in this manner.
I basically think this person has let Homecare reputation down and I will be looking else where so British gas you have just lost yet another customer.

A typical ex-nationalised 'untouchable' company operating fraudulently.
British Gas hoodwinked my restaurant staff in Nov 2018 to 'fix' the smart meter to work on MAXDEMAND tariff which means a minimum bill is issued irrespective of actual usage. Bills went from ¬£111 to ¬£1505 monthly which forced closure of this small restaurant. Knowledge of MAXDEMAND tariff did not come about until 2021. BG offered no such contract nor explanation nor willingness to resolve.
If this was not true, I would be sued. British Gas are definitely NOT RECOMMENDED as a business supplier.

Switched to British Gas in July 2020 - problems with communication from outset especially with compatibility of my smart meter. Despite numerous requests to rectify, a BG engineer did eventually call prior to Christmas to address issues but could not change my smart meter monitor as he did not have a 'job number' to do so. Promised to call back but despite appointments made, no one showed due to 'strike' action. BG's app is useless - kept updating but failed to give any accurate info on usage or current bills. Tried phoning BG but gave up after 30 minutes on 'hold'. Tried web-chats but mixed response from BG operators & problems with smart meter connectivity never resolved.

Customer service is very bad. Email complaints ignored. The chat service on their app is basically useless. Assistants in South Africa. Almost impossible to speak to someone in this country. Been given conflicting information. British gas states how much they care about their customers. Absolute nonsense. Just after üí∑.
Being promised phone call backs but not materialised. Absolute sham of a company. Since leaving to join üêô Energy of course BG have been in contact to try to make me stay with them. Too much too little too late Im afraid. And as I owe them around ¬£40 being threatened with court action. You couldn't make it up. They have no interest in supporting customers who need help with their bills.

Previously we had a service booked with them as part of a Homecare package and the engineer never turned up. Recently, we had a boiler service as part of the Homecare package. British gas sent a contractor to do the job. After he had left we could smell gas. An independent gas leak body came to switch off our gas supply and condemned the boiler saying there was gas 'pumping out'' of the top of it. When we complained to British Gas they said there was not much they could do because the contractor did not work for British gas and they told us to take up the issue with the contracted company!!! Once the boiler was fixed, it took them three months to reply to our complaint. When they finally responded, they called and emailed during one day and because I didn't respond that day they closed the case!!! The fact that they repeatedly described CREATING a big gas leak in our home, and then leaving the premises with my family (including 2 young children) in it as 'an inconvenience' is just appalling. The customer service has been diabolical all round. My advice would be to sign up to an energy company who put safety first and who treat their customers with respect.

Vile corporate bullies!! British Gas decided after 9 months ( of my account closure) that I owed them ¬£6k. The calls went back and forth, ( as the call centre abroad preferred not to put anything in writing) . Eventually I called in the ombudsman who deemed BG to have billed and over charged me incorrectly. I was made an offer to write off the debt, I was not told that it was the final offer, or that they do not offer compensation or apologies!!! So I declined  the offer, which they immediately withdrew, out of spite! . The ombudsman was shocked at this  response by BG Kirsty Wooten, but said it‚Äôs unusual but can be done. This customer relations advisor, has totally ignored the fact that I‚Äôm a single mother with a disabled child, I was besides myself for 3 months worrying about the implications of such a big bill, but BG showed no compassion. Eventually, they 
 reduced the bill to ¬£800+, but in actual fact, that is because they made a mistake and deposited ¬£900+into my account. So I‚Äôm paying back their mistake. I have now just received an email from a debt agency, asking for the money. 
Whatever you do, take my advice, don‚Äôt trust British Gas. They‚Äôre a bunch of gangsters, go with octopus energy or any of the others.
Further to BG reply  . 
I asked ms Lindsey Howgate of the ombudsman service to contact BG  to ask to reinstate the original offer. She asked me was it explained to me that it was their final offer ? And did I know BG could retract it . 
This was never explained 
. However, the ombudsman did not contact BG. Says it all really!! 

I think British Gas have treated me appallingly, they think by saying they offered a goodwill gesture that it was enough to get away with their utter disdain of their customers. Thanks  to them and the ombudsman cartel, I have a massive debt hanging over my head. 
They should be ashamed of themselves!

Absolutely appalling EVERYTHING after five years of complaining trying to be released from their clutches I drew the final straw with debt they considered me owing and had an IVA put in place ... a legal agreement between myself and creditors because I really just need to get away from British Gas, they agreed terms which is legally binding BUT they continue to take debt from my pre payment meter, I have spent all week on the phone much of the week In tears they are actually breaking the law taking debt off me now that the IVA is in place! They have had two copies of the agreement emailed to them this week, they confirmed receipt of sent email and assure me I will be refunded, nothing absolutely nothing has changed yet, they continue to take debt, the customer service is absolutely appalling I‚Äôve had to speak to people in any other country apart from the U.K. I‚Äôve had to explain what an IVA is numerous times, I‚Äôve been cut off a total of 7 times this week, seriously got me so down I‚Äôve just sobbed I just want to get away from BG it‚Äôs the worst company by far I‚Äôve ever had dealings with, the point of the IVA is so they will release me to another company and I just can‚Äôt get them to do their job!

Absolutely felt I was in limbo with 100% no choices. So frustrating and anxiety ridden. They obviously only care about money. Customer service is an absolute joke and embarrassment. Staff are so contrary between giving different answers out for the same questions and faults. Never know where you stand. I was on a Pre payment meter so couldn't leave until debt was cleared. They couldn't even decide if I was able to have my meter transferred back to credit. When Assistants dont know the answers to a query they often hang up which is diabolical, especially when one has been waiting for over 30 minutes to get through. I was finally able to speak to a customer assistant in South Africa who told me that my meter would indeed be transferred bad to a credit one. And it was the next day. Its unbelievable to actually be feeling grateful to actually have your requirements dealt with without any thing going wrong. And now Im with Octopus üêô Energy and I can say 100% have been amazing, caring, communicative, friendly and so knowledgeable and professional.

Absolutely Shocking company. My vulnerable parents were (and continue to be) quarantined in another country without access to their bills or post (that I have continually asked to be emailed) to pay the very low gas bill. Due to gov restrictions I have not been able to get up there to check the mail from another part of the UK so the bill has been unpaid for a few months. This is also after BG had taken thousands of pounds out of their account over the years on an estimated bill without ever checking and refused to pay it back. They then broke into the house without anyone permission to fit a pre-paid meter and left the house in a state like a burglar had broken in. now they refuse to issue cards for the meter. great way to treat the elderly and vulnerable people in our country.

I then found out it was British Gas lite! I was informed they disputed the fact I was a new tenant in the shop (only for gas, the electricity they didn‚Äôt have a problem with) and even though I and my landlord had provided up to date meter readings, legal proof of my tenancy...I was still on a ‚Äúdeemed rate‚Äù with British Gas until March 2021! Unfortunately due to the stupid fact British Gas lite are an online provider...you HAVE to endure lengthy waits to speak to someone on the webchat (I have always had to wait at least half an hour to speak to someone) and every time I speak to an advisor I‚Äôm given a different answer as to why the transfer didn‚Äôt happen as requested, and sometimes I‚Äôm just told they don‚Äôt have that information! I spoke with edf and citizens advise and was told to make a formal complaint as the bills I received were astronomical!!!!! Estimated readings that were nearly 5 times higher than my actual usage! (In a period of 14 days they estimated I had used ¬£267 worth of gas...being it was end of Feb 2021 to beginning March 2021....during the lockdown and the shop was closed). Once I made the complaint, I then started getting bombarded with calls from their debt collector agency (credit style) demanding I pay a huge sum. I explained to them I was in dispute and they asked I send them photos of my meter readings (which clearly show the extent of British Gas‚Äô error) and evidence of my contracts with EDF.
I‚Äôve now escalated this with the ombudsman and have now been informed...British gas lite had NO RIGHT to refuse my energy supply transfer in the first place! 
I can‚Äôt emphasise enough just how angry this whole issue has made me! I‚Äôve lost sleep, getting to the point I‚Äôm pulling my hair out!!!!!! I have a new business to run and especially in this time of covid and uncertainty I can do with out extra headaches especially ones created by someone else‚Äôs blatant mistake!
With out doubt who ever runs British Gas lite needs to be removed as they obviously have no clue what they are doing and the business needs to be re thought as it simply doesn‚Äôt work! (For an online only service...they have very little online presence!)
Utterly disgusting!

We have been with British Gas for 11 years, last year we had the smart meters installed and soon after that problems began. First smart meter lost connection and everything started playing up. We called British Gas and they made us wait for a month and a half with dodgy electrics. On the day specified engineer did not turn up. Soon after that meter broke completely and we had no electricity. After 2 days of being switched from customer advisor to customer advisor and being ""disconnected"" we got an engineer appointment (he did not turned up) , another engineer remotely restored power temporarily. Now we are without electricity again and getting it repaired will take... I don't even know. We have small kids in the house and are going to leave British Gas ASAP but until than would like to have the power, we pay a lot of money for. My advice is, do not use British Gas and if are, leave as soon as you can.

This company is appalling, I‚Äôve had boiler insurance with them for several years! Had issues with my boiler since November 2020. Issues were never fixed so had to have engineers out several times. The last engineer condemned my boiler and said it wasnt repairable. I was quoted over ¬£3000 from them & other companies! I asked BG for help as I couldn‚Äôt get credit or any family members to ask to borrow that kind of money! BG said try the government schemes or pay 50% up front and pay the rest at a letter date!! Or ask a family member or friend to take out finance for you! I can‚Äôt do any of that, so I am now left without hot water or heating!! Not one of them were helpful, just said it‚Äôs all in our fine print. They have sent my payable invoice of ¬£60 to a debt managers company and told me that it‚Äôs out of their hands!! I have raised a complaint with BG who have said it can take 8 weeks for the complaint to be acknowledged!! Absolutely disgusting company. What was I paying boiler insurance for?

Every year British Gas delay my Annual boiler service by about 2 months so that after about 6 years I have paid for 7 services and only had 6.  This to my mind amounts to fraud.  This year after pestering BG they arranged a service for 14 May 2021.  On 13 May they cancelled that service and rescheduled for 4 June 2021.  On 23 May I received a text cancelling the 4 June service and offering a ¬£65 refund of ¬£65 as compensation.  There was no mention of when the service would be rescheduled.  On 28 May I received a phone call repeating the same information as above.  When asked when the service would be rescheduled I was told that the ¬£65 was in lieu of having the boiler serviced and I would not be receiving a boiler service.  In effect I have been cut off from having the annual boiler service I was relying on.  I find this behaviour by BG totally unacceptable.  They make the excuse about Corona virus while at the same time advertising on the TV that ""they are there for you"" or some such twaddle.  The main reason they are providing an inadequate service is because they are trying to worsen the working conditions of their service engineers who are understandably striking over the issue.  The previous service was done by and engineer from Newcastle upon Tyne (we live in Leicestershire 150 miles away) who was put up in a hotel in Kettering for a week at a time because they did not have enough staff in the Midlands - what a way to run a business

Well I receive a email from BG about my complaint about not turning up for an appointment which they confirmed twice by text but then failed to tell me they had cancelled the service due to other priorities and gave me another date in July without asking me if I am available. What are the chances they won't turn up for that either. The email they sent me confirmed that they had received my complaint and would get back to me within 8 weeks!! Are they serious? Or is this a comedy sketch. 2 months to sort a complaint. Mr Ombudsman please investigate BG without delay, they are extracting money under false pretenses!!

Shocking customer service - Refund my ¬£800. Having moved from British gas in February 2020 they continued to take money for gas from me via direct debit which they never supplied. I only realised this last month when they emailed saying they were increasing my monthly fee as I was out of contract. I have spoken to the call centre in South Africa who are unable to transfer me to anyone in the U.K./manager/complaints team and they investigated the issue which took 2 weeks. After hitting the investigation deadline on the 18th of May it seems British Gas owe me ¬£800 as they supplied nothing (taking money under false pretences?). I've now chased for my money 5 times always getting the same response from the call centre in South Africa - the refund is blocked due to the value. Final word today from me was I'll give until 5pm for a customer complaints team get in touch finally and confirm my money is refunded before I put my complaint on your social media sites. Complaint also logged with Ofgem now considering taking legal action. Will never be a British Gas customer (impossible to speak to someone in Great Britain) again.

After couple of days, it turned up that I've got 3 account set up for the same address including two DD and a bill send by mail. So I called them again. They advised me to pay senr bill so I did.

I was with British Gas for a few years.
All of a sudden they began to take ¬£100 more per month from my bank, it wasn't until I had emails from other companies that I pay by direct debit telling me their payments were declined that I looked into it.
They had been helping themselves for a few months and put me in trouble with 3 other companies (Disgusting Right?) I eventually left British Gas and arranged to pay off an amount they said I owed. I payed of the second monthly payment, I then receive a message from a company called BPO??. British Gas had passed my details to them and I now owe this company the money I owed BG. On phoning BG, I was told that because I had payed the second payment a couple of days early, the payment due on the 19th of the month showed as missed. HOW PATHETIC. Not only had BG put me in debt with other companies by taking more money without even letting me know, but they had now sold the debt I had with them to another blood sucker. 
To round it off just nice, I had a message from my credit reference agency telling me that my score has now been damaged by not paying my bill.
I am absolutely struck dumb,,,
How could a massive organisation like British Gas shaft a normal working class person like this? 
I know how, they don't give a toss about their customers, just the money they can squeeze out of us.

So we got switched over to British Gas in January without asking to be from the council. Been asking for 5 months to be switched over to pre payment meter. Instead they put us on a quarterly bill making the bill sky high. As well asked for a appointment to get our meter read. After 5 months still nothing. Then when you speak to the customer service team you cannot speak to anyone in England yet it is called British gas.

We have a gas leak in the inlet pipe to the gas fire in our lounge. Not large but noticeable. BG notified early Thursday morning, Cadern engineer arrived within an hour and, did a thorough check, finally identifying the source of the leak. So far so good. He could not tackle the problem, so we reported an emergency through the BG (0333)helpline. This helpline eventually lets you talk to someone, after about 10minutes listening to recoded garbage. THIS HELPLINE TURNS OUT TO BE A CALL CENTRE IN SOUTH AFRICA. We then had to wait for over 24 hours for an engineer. When he arrived he could not fix the problem because it is in the pipe below floor level. No complaints about the engineer he was very helpful and did his best to expedite the solution. An ‚Äòexpert‚Äô was needed to determine what needed to be done, but he couldn‚Äôt attend until Tuesday, so another 4 days without heating, gas for cooking etc. Further calls, each day, to the helpline were of no help, so it‚Äôs microwave meals and bed socks for a few more days. Then if the carpets and floorboards have to come up how much longer will we be suffering. BG have an industrial dispute with their engineering staff and many have left rather than accept the new contracts they were offered, we used to have 41 covering or area, now there are only 17. No wonder service is so bad.

Discovered water leaking through ceiling. Not sure if this was a plumbing or central heating issue so reported it as a leak (my Home Care contract covers both). Managed to book online for an engineer to come the following morning. So far so good - or so I thought. The Engineer did arrive but not until after lunch just as a was on the phone to BG (in a queue!) to ask what was happening. After a very quick inspection he decided that the leak was coming from a central heating valve which, because he was from the plumbing division, he could not fix but said he would get back to BG and arrange a gas engineer to come. BG then phoned me to inform me that as I still had heating, hot water and electrics this was not an emergency and that the earliest appointment to replace the valve was 8th June, SIX WEEKS away. When I protested he just repeated that it was (in BGs opinion) not an emergency and basically I could take it or leave it and if I wanted to take it I would have to provide my credit card details there and then. 

I have raised a formal complaint with BG but was told this could take 4-6 weeks to respond!

I have had Home Care for many years and, on the odd occasion had the need to call them out, had always has excellent service. 

This company has gone downhill rapidly. It no longer cares for its customers and service is non existent. I shall not be renewing my Home Care(less) contract.

After they cancelled our annual service twice they finally turned up two weeks ago. The engineer called the job through to his office as a ‚Äúnear miss‚Äù as the fumes were too high, and the fault of them not coming out at the correct time to do the service. He serviced the boiler and then all safe. Within 2 minutes of leaving the boiler stopped working. After finally speaking to a human (my trick is not to say a word or do anything when prompted to speak or key in anything on keypad) I was told the engineer couldn‚Äôt be recalled and I have now waited two weeks for someone to come out and resolve a problem that wasn‚Äôt there before they touched it.

My boiler covered by Homecare recently failed leaving us without hot water and central heating.  After encountering a little delay on the automated system with my appointment I eventually spoke to an operative at British Gas Call centre, believe this was in South Africa (but may be mistaken).  
The operative took ownership of the situation and communicated with the the planning team to ensure early attendance of a field engineer.  The first chap attended and determined the parts required however due to workloads a second engineer (Andy 3995143) attended. He was particularly clear and fully understanding of the requirement for our quite old and unique boiler.  There was a need for follow up visits, including weekend and he was absolutely brilliant.  I appreciate these are challenging times for both the field engineers as well as BG itself but sometimes it is easier to be negative about our own businesses so I felt it only appropriate to commend BG in the way that they dealt with my own situation ; including the lady in the call centre as well as the excellent field engineer.  WELL DONE BG !!

Really bad service with British Gas Home Care. Dish washer broke down, the earliest appointment I could get was two week later. I stayed in all afternoon, no one turned up! I looked on line and they had booked another appointment for me! No phone call, I tried ringing, I could not get hold of any one, eventually chatted on line and they were not at all helpful, rediculous  having to wait four weeks to get some to fix your dish washer. I'm still waiting four months for some to fix my toilet.

Today the boiler sprang a leak in my 86-year-old Mum‚Äôs home - water pouring into the kitchen/blowing electrics etc. So, no heating or hot water. She has had a Homecare agreement with British Gas for years and pays a substantial sum for it each month. A phone call to the advertised number resulted in her being told - by the automated system - that an engineer could visit but not until ten days time. Attempts via the online chat service/Twitter to make contact and explain that she‚Äôs a vulnerable customer facing an emergency resulted in promises that an engineer would arrive today and would phone first. When the phone call came, it was from Dynorod who - on chatting with Mum - decided they had been asked to get involved by mistake, so we had to start the contact process all over again. Since then, we were told that an engineer would be with us by 6pm, then by 10pm - still no show. The system for making contact with British Gas is utterly appalling: how can they expect an 86-year-old widow to navigate her way through the online contact methods (which don‚Äôt seem to result in any effective action anyway). Disgusting customer service.

Just about impossible to have any contact with this company. They actively discriminate against people that do not have any computer skills/knowledge. Just trying to send a meter reading is a nightmare. It's as if they just don't want to speak to or deal with customers. My advice is if you are not that computer literate stay away from this company.

I have had no heating for weeks.  British Gas finally sent an engineer today, who said he had fixed the problem.  After he left I turned on the heating only to find it was still not working.  Immediately rang B.G. to get engineer back only to be told I have to wait another 2 weeks before they can fit me in.  Disgusting service and way too expensive.

 I'm not exaggerating. Everything is wrong with Brit Gas. = Terrible customer service. Over pricing and wrong billing. I'm now well overdrawn because they are asking for payments for energy - gas and electricity which I've never used. Then threaten with bailiffs.

I have been with British Gas since 2019, had smart meters installed and paid by direct debit. Every bill I received said that my payments are on point to cover my usage so I thought nothing of it and continued to let my direct debit continue out of my account each month. I have recently changed supplier and got a bill of ¬£900+ from BG saying I was in debit. When querying it, it turns out that there was a system error and my quarterly reviews hadn‚Äôt been carried out. I have permission for them to speak to my mam on my behalf as I work during the week and they have promised her at least 3 calls backs, two weeks later we haven‚Äôt heard anything and when she calls to ask what‚Äôs going on, they‚Äôre now refusing to speak to her. I finish work at 4:30pm everyday and their wait time on a call is 35mins, since they close at 5pm, I can never speak to anyone. 
I have been left with a debt of over ¬£900 through no fault of my own and have no one I can speak to about it. I am absolutely disgusted by the service we have received and I‚Äôm a loss with what I‚Äôm supposed to do now to resolve this issue.

Booking a service on line is very good. But booking a repair is a night mare as the dairy is six or seven weeks waiting. We had a leek in the boiler and a bucket collecting the water under the boiler. It was a hard trying to explain on line that we wanted a repair ASAP and its also bank holiday.

For some strange reason I was asked my 'date of birth' I told the 'advisor' they did not need that and they continued happily.  I suggest a backroom scammer gain info on people.  Why is it that British gas app never work properly until the next version and then a new problem arises.  P.S.  I am now wasting 30 minute so far online trying to get help.

I don't usually take the time to leave reviews but on this occasion I feel I should. I spoke to a lovely guy called Simon (collections department) today who helped me work out my arrears with British Gas. Not only this, but he took the time to explain how my new meters work, set me up a new direct debit and explained exactly how the units and charges work. He has arranged an appointment to get my gas meter fixed so that I do not have the added hassle of uploading my meter readings and creating room to call back into arrears. This is the first time I have had a thoroughly enjoyable experience when dealing with a utility company. More reps like Simon please :)

I placed a review here yesterday of my experience with British gas being executor for my mother in law estate, so this is part two.
I phoned today to ask why they have given me a new customer number. They should have just changed the name on the previous account which is what I thought they were doing, which they said I had to do to sort out the readings, This should be all the same account, I have not moved in, the house is still empty, I do not own the house, I AM JUST THE EXECUTOR.
Having explained this to the lady on the phone, I asked what happened to the 300 and odd units that they have overestimated on both the gas and electricity, which I have paid on behalf of her estate?  Also, why does it not start on 26/03/21 when my name went on the bill, but on the 09/12/20 if this is a new account.

The app is next to useless for information as they have wiped their estimated reading off, that was on there at first for the gas and already I have had two different payments owing when I only changed it on the 26/03/21, ( 4 days ago) and why are the bills on there estimated? I put readings on the app like I was requested.

My mother in laws customer ref was 8500 5994 0102, apparently this has been closed, do you just keep that over payment then back date the new customer?
As she stated she couldn't help me, she stated she was transferring me to Home Move? Didn't  get the chance to ask why she just cut me off, I waited 15 minutes on hold there, then phoned them myself, 40 minutes waiting it said, so I rang their complaints  department to be told their premises had been evacuated, and to call back later!!!  Which I must say made me laugh.

Would have given no stars but won‚Äôt allow that so had to begrudgingly give one star!!
Really don‚Äôt bother with British Gas Homecare complete waste of your money. 
I was unfortunate to have to deal with this company had a boiler breakdown booked the service at the same time, advised to contact a neighbour (of whom lives literallynext door, information provided to BG) and they would let the engineer in the property, as the person in the property was in hospital. The engineer attended didn‚Äôt bother speaking to the neighbour, put a card through the door and left. Giving benefit of the doubt I arranged yet another visit, same thing happened again. Now bear in mind that British Gas state they will help the vulnerable wherever they can!!
So I made another appointment at this point I was appalled by the service received, but this plan has been paid for over years for an event like this!! So another apt made for the breakdown and again the supposedly free service that is included in the policy. The engineer actually contacted the neighbour this time, the engineer went in the property adjusted the thermostat and left. So apart from the hot water still not working when he left, the service wasn‚Äôt done a 50 excess had been paid for that visit on top of already paying ¬£40+ a month. When I called BG I was told that there was no service booked in, which I know i requested. 
At this point I cancelled the policy and got my own engineer to fit the part that was needed.
The appalling service didn‚Äôt end there I put a complaint in, was told this should not have happen!! And was insulted by being offered ¬£50 which only gives the excess payment back, nothing for the appalling service, and the incompetence of staff and also the inconvenience of everything. For such a big company it is disgusting and I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money, it will be cheaper and less stress to just get you own private engineer to carry out any work, because the money you spend and the stress you get put through isn‚Äôt worth it, may as well throw the money down the drain.
So I put this on their Facebook page, was told to PM them and give my details and they will look into it, well what a surprise don‚Äôt hear anything back!!

My smart meter doesn't work. Phoned British Gas on Feb 23rd and I was told that someone would be round in a few days. Nothing happened so phoned again on MARCH 25th. I was told that no-one had been round (No-one had thought it polite or business-like to let me know why) but someone could come round and they would need access to the house. I said we are shielding so I was asked to provide a meter reading.
I tried to provide meter reading, but the meter reading site was down(!).
I tried phoning and was told that I couldn't leave a meter reading because I had a smart meter(!!).
I phoned again and got through to a woman who started registering my reading then disappeared - I assume she'd hung up.
I tried several more calls, but every time the phone was answered the person hung up without saying anything.
Finally, I tried your website and after some time I was told I was eleventh in the queue. I accepted defeat.
Are your staff having fun at the expense of the customer?

After pushing and arguing that it was not okay to keep the individual in the house under these circumstances they agreed to send out an engineer. 

An engineer calls at 22.34pm and says he'll be there in 10minutes! He never turned up! How disgusting!

Homecare boiler cover policy is just a scam to take your money!
Had a fault with my boiler late last year. Engineer called and carried out what I can only describe as a temporary fix.
This proved correct, as the identical issue arose about 3 weeks ago. Requested a further engineer visit and got an email confirming my appointmnet slot for Tusday 23/3/21. ( about a two week wait! )
However, 3 days before engineer was due to call, BG phoned to say the engineer visit was cancelled and they would be able to re-arrange vist for sometime in June! ( several months away!!!)
Suffice to say I found this to be totally unacceptable!
I had a confirmed appointment slot and failed to see why this could not be honoured!

BG service has progressively deteriorated over recent years; definitely PRE COVID-19.  

I have had full homecare cover for 9 years, brand new boiler under full warranty. 

I've NEVER had the same ""engineer"" twice.

At many visits each ""engineer"" panics my tenants, tells them the boiler/heating/gas are unsafe. Each time BG quote v expensive repairs & often full boiler replacement.   When I meet /call them & say ""Go ahead, I have full BG coverage, zero excess, including warranty boiler replacement"" the problem suddenly disappears.  Completely.  Every.single.time.  Took me a while to figure this all out.

Just one example - one visit in winter 2019 I waited over 2 weeks, no heat/hot water, stressed tenants; after 2 visits, 2 separate quotes for unneeded ¬£¬£¬£ repairs & even a new boiler, I attended & met the 3rd ""engineer"", who had driven down to W1 from the Midlands.  I wanted full details.  He told me both prior ""engineers"" were wrong, what I needed was... a power flush!  Bingo. Power flushes are not covered by Homecare. Kerching!  He spent an hour drawing, explaining, had me convinced. He wrote me a  ¬£¬£¬£¬£ quote, then left.

I immediately solved the actual boiler problem myself (released pressure via pressure valve).

BG wrote to confirm ¬£¬£¬£¬£ power flush quote.

I phoned (still convinced at this stage) to book power flush - ""Sorry, no-one available, try next week"".

After 3 weeks of this, I asked  the chap to just make a note that I accept the quote & to book it when the next slot is available. No.  I would need to keep calling BG every week.  After much to-ing and fro-ing, he very rudely said there was no availability for the next 6 months, and likely not after that either.  When I asked him what he would advise me to do, he just shouted at me. I said so BG have quoted me for something they could never deliver.  He shouted at me and hung up.

I  read around & found that BG notoriously advise a power flush when there is nothing else billable found, so I put it down to experience.

The past year has been atrocious, the BG app no longer works for landlords, the website non-functioning for days, no-one picking up the phone, just recorded messages to use the app/website.  When website finally up, ""engineer"" arrives for blocked drain & leak, he tells tenants he does not do leaks, they need to book call specifically for leaks (which I HAD done). Could not rebook as website down again, no-one answering.

I've spent the last 3 weeks trying to book gas safety certificate online with the website not accepting the booking, instead repeated messages that GSC was not due (it expires Tuesday!). I tried the live chat, explained all, was told to ""book it on the website"", explained again, told to book it on website again, explained again in CAPITAL LETTERS, the operator disconnected.

I spent 3.5 hours on hold yesterday, constantly being redirected to website, finally got through & got a human to book GSC for Tuesday.

I recently received my annual renewal quote - ¬£696, a 20% increase for 9 years loyalty. 

I spent 45 minutes on hold today, finally got through & got a human to renegotiate renewal price.

Whilst talking to the (lovely) BG phone operator, I checked new customer prices online (¬£503 for exact same cover).  I supplied my other phone number for this quote; within seconds BG sales called me on that number, keen to sell to me - it seems COVID-19 does not affect them SELLING at all... 

That was the last straw, I cancelled the contract (& operator recorded a formal complaint).

Homecare service is a big rip off and BG doesn't follow their own contract. With homecare, we are supposed to have the gas boiler (installed by BG) checked every 12 months... the last two times it was checked, was almost 18 months since the previous check.
Then, had a problem with washing machine (under homecare), called them and they could not send an engineer out before a week! The inconvenience of not having a washing machine is one thing, but as our fault caused a small fire (luckily extinguished by brave husband), we don't feel safe waiting this long.
We have been on homecare for many years, but will be cancelling now.

Awful service.
Moved into a new house in October and realised after a few that the meter reading hadn't changed. Spent hours on the phone trying to get through to BG. Eventually managed to get them to book an engineer visit to fix the meter. This was organised in December for February. This was subsequently cancelled due to ""covid and lockdown"". No idea when/if they will rearrange. We are paying an estimated amount for gas and have no idea if this is remotely accurate or not. We want to change supplier to a better tariff. We inherited a variable rate tariff which will be increased on on 1 April. Complained through the on line chat for complaints. Simply told that covid and lockdown meant an engineer couldn't come. This is difficult to understand a year in to the pandemic. Other companies seem to manage to send out personnel (eg I have had to have my oven fixed and Neff had no problem sending an engineer). Given that the meter is outside and the boiler immediately inside the back door, an engineer would not have to have any contact indoors with us. Meanwhile we are stuck with an uncompetitive tariff and cannot change supplier. The web chat complaints person told me I could change to the fixed tariff but I explained that we did not want to stay with BG and be tied into a tariff with them. He said it was a customer choice to be on a variable tariff! Pointed out it was a customer choice to be able to move supplier but they were preventing us doing this. I was told that they had opened a complaint and then closed it despite having left the matter unresolved. Sadly BG are and have been for a long time a terrible company for customer service. Feel trapped by them on an expensive tariff. Avoid them if you can.

Virtually impossible to contact. Phone numbers are hidden in the maze of the website as they do everything in their power to avoid you having to call. If you do find a number, the automated service will tell you in no uncertain terms that they are only able to help those that are vulnerable, living alone without gas and electricity and nobody is able to help them. 

You can try to get through the automated intro but she'll ask what your call is concerning - whatever answer you give will likely be met with ""Sorry, our lines are not open at the moment"". No mention of when they do open.

If you do get past the first boss, you'll be put on hold for a good half an hour before an advisor picks up. However, they'll inevitably be the wrong advisor and they'll put you through to another team, with another half hour on hold. At this point you might have a slim chance of getting what you want, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

Online chat is awful as they take ages to respond and you'll likely get passed from person to person who will all ask for all of your basic details and a description of your situation, despite having written it all already just half a scroll up away in the chat. You can email them, but they won't respond.

I had a British gas account for a property. This property is now rented out since October and the tenant is paying to British gas (they showed me the bill). British gas keep asking me to pay for the gas electric anyway even though they went out and took a meter reading the day the tenant moved in. I have tried creating an online account (refuses to recognise email), online chat (just tells me to create online account ), emailing, writing, telephoning (cuts me off after an hour wait). I have cancelled direct debit and they just keep hassling me to pay the bill that keeps going up.

My boiler has been broken for three weeks. I am working from home in freezing cold conditions with a pandemic raging in the background. I also live with a severe asthmatic. I pay over ¬£53 a month for my Homecare plan and have never used it in all the years I have been a member until now. You can no longer reach a human being by calling. I have had to use their online chat system. I have wasted 6 hours in total booking an engineer with confirmations and reference numbers to prove it. Three times an engineer has not turned up and no courtesy call to explain why. I am still without hot water and heat despite it being freezing temperatures. I am totally disgusted by British Gas and Home Care. They care more about shareholder value than their loyal customers. If the NHS and the likes of Amazon can function during a pandemic a rich utilities company can do the same. I have been left totally high and dry. I will now write to the ombudsman, the British Gas Chairman (for what its worth). I shall be cancelling Homecare and moving to Octopus. The ¬£53 I save a month I will put into a kitty in case I have a problem and will find a caring company to take my business to. Shame on you British Gas and Homecare...I have experienced zero care and nothing but upset and frustration from this experience. There are millions of vulnerable people relying on a service that clearly can‚Äôt cope.

Most dreadful service I‚Äôve ever encountered. Had a problem with our oven and after countless phone calls, cancelled appointments (after arranging  time off work) and engineers coming, not having parts etc , they sent an engineer out who left us with a gas leak (my teenage daughter came my house from school to it and called me at work). Had to call cadence who declared the house unsafe and turned everything off. Many phone calls that day (after being cut off on the phone, being told they‚Äôd call when they didn‚Äôt), they sent an engineer at midnight (we were told before 10pm) who told us that he couldn‚Äôt fix it and someone else would have to come the next morning (more time off work!). They actually sent the engineer who caused the gas leak in the first place... didn‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry.  The pain of having to navigate through their automated phone system has quite genuinely reduced me to tears of frustration.  Avoid at all costs

Gave 1 star as zero stars not available. Took over 1.5 hours to speak to a human, live chat cut off when I got to no55 in the queue and the only number on the home care page was for complaints - which got me through to a robot type chat which in my opinion did not understand English. Boiler not serviced since August 2019, earliest appointment is April 2021 and I am going to charged an excess payment if boiler breaks down before then. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt break down if it was serviced regularly!!! But no reduction in monthly contract charge. So they are basically taking the money and not delivering on what I am paying for. COVID of course is used as the excuse but this is becoming a rather old and tired excuse now. Other less profitable businesses have adapted and continued to provide service to customers so it is time British Gas got itself sorted out. My advice is DO NOT Take out home care cover with BG if you are expecting to receive what they say they will deliver - you will be disappointed.

Tried numerous times to renew the homecare policy on my late mother's property.  Numerous calls took me thru lengthy messages and menus only to play a recorded message saying they've closed their lines because they're too busy. Finally spoke to someone who couldn't then renew because their systems weren't working to take payment.  Asked me to call back next day but then same problem with lines closed again. Tried live chat with Lauren who just suggested calling same closed line.  Explained this so she promised to call me back in 5-10 minutes but never bothered.  At no point have they even acknowledged my mum's death or offered any sympathy.  Truly terrible customer service.  Avoid this firm.  They simply do not care.  Aside from my experience, how can they justify closing off their homecare customer service lines during the worst cold spell in decades when that service is supposed to exist specifically for times like these.

Only to be told they are on strike and earliest they can get an engineer to me is in 7 days. I am currently shielding as I am clincally vulnerable, I cant even pack my bags and go somewhere else until the engineer date due to the current government restrictions. They told me to find an engineer and they will reimburse me, I can't afford to do that. So what exactly am I paying ¬£50 a month for, No service.

If you wished to have piece of mind and relax at night, knowing your electricity and gas supplier will at least ensure you are never left cold in the dark, especially during winter and in a pandemic lockdown DO NOT SIGN WITH BRITISH GAS!
Topped up my electricity meter 2 days ago. The money never showed on the screen. I am a key worker, so was at work all day today. Came back to a dark, freezing flat. Smart meter has two buttons. Small button was flashing red. Pressed it. Electricity came back on again. The meter screen showed I was using credit of ¬£5 (that's as much as it is allowed to use, after that electricity is shut down and you can't turn it on). Tried to call British Gas emergency, was re diarected to UK Power Networks automatically. No email. So decided to try online chat (this was at 7pm). Waited 30 people on the que. The customer service agent told me she'll transfer me to top up meters team. Another 30 customers and it was my turn. The person had no idea what meter was top up smart meter and gave me copy paste instructions, which made no sense and nothing to deal with my meter. When I pointed out that the instructions are telling me to press buttons on the meter that are not there. There was silence. I started asking: ""shall I try pressing longer the only big existing button on the meter"", ""shall I see if anything might be obstructing the cables connecting the meter"" (I don't know, I am not an engineer) and etc. He replied I should try all I think is right and that he will transfer me to the smart meters team. Another 31 customers and it was my turn. The person read all my correspondence with his colleagues and said he'll transfer me to a team member from another department. After another 30 customers it was again finally my turn. The chat closed off and a survey regarding British Gas customer service popped out (that was at 9:30pm). No apologies, no explanation where are my money and what's wrong with the meter or their system. The meter is currently showing ¬£3 and by tomorrow will be off again. However, this time there is no credit. I am at work all day. And it's extremely difficult to sit on the phone for two, three hours so I can speak with very very low level incompetent trainees. All of them are. There is no other explanation. The meterr is a smart meter, obviously functioning fine but their system didn't upload the money and none of their staff acknowledged that. There is not a single one that knows what an electricity meter is. I most likely will have to find alternative accomodation untill they sort out their system. Dispicable and discussing!
Side note: My top up gas meter (not a smart meter) is chargeable only by a card which I can top up in a shop 16 minutes walk from my property (not even on my way back home from work but further down). Never been asked by British Gas to change it to a smart meter and when I questioned it at the begining when I moved in 2 years ago, they said they are not yet offering this service in my area, which is only 40 minutes walk from the Cambridge City Center. What an ancient, exhausting bpractice. My parents live 15 minutes walk from me and they have British Gas representatives/salesmen almost every month on their door. Strange isn't it?!

Although we pay BG almost 1K a year to cover everything, they refuse to repair it, they would have repaired our tumble dryer, which doesn‚Äôt have standing water tho. We are both in our mid 70‚Äôs my partner is diabetic, we‚Äôre doing all we can to keep safe, yet BG do not consider the risk of legionnaires to be a problem!! One manager agreed it was a health hazard and booked an engineer to come today - nobody came and no communication. Phone up and was told that the earliest we can expect a repair is the end of March!! Guess who is cancelling the DD? I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted. I would give a fat O if I could.

Booked sn annual service

Booked sn annual service , been in the diary for 3 months. Engineer , let's call him that turns up, not from British gas, third party, no prior warning that wouldn't be British gas engineer. He asks if he should take his shoes off , erm yes I think you should, goes upstairs, I can't service boiler , advised its been serviced for several years by British gas without problem. He hadn't a clue about the model . Not trained. Gone in 60 seconds, offered new date , 3 months off. I have taken the morning off work for this nonsense!

And it it will not improve  , too many fat cat idiots who've made a simple thing impossible to use , you can't even top up locally , I'm off this sinking ship ASAP and advice all to to do the same . There are loads and loads of better providers out there , my last day with this farce of a company , they deserve a base of zero customers , then they can try and stay warm with no income .

I wrote a review of British Gas aka Bloody Ghastly last year after almost 9 months and three visits to the Ombudsman. Now, after the 9 months abuse from British Gas, they have started their abuse of me once again this week. Incorrect amount taken out of my direct debit, no forward notice given for the direct debit, ( which was greatly increased). Spoke to someone slumbering in a call centre who did not have a clue what day it was, then he put the phone down on me mid-discussion. This guy was still using my old e-mail address from 10 months ago !!!  Now I must start to waste more of my life contacting these morons again on Monday. ALWAYS ask for a Letter of Deadlock when in dispute with British Gas. You can request one after 6 weeks if they have not resolved your dispute. British Gas are then legally required to hand one over. Then take it to the Ombudsman who is excellent and who will bring this lot to account. Make plenty of notes and log/detail all calls. Telephone the Executive Office in Slough where the Directors hold out. They do not speak at mere mortals but you may fare better than the standard ""customer service"" lottery they operate.

Bill raised without my consent. From around ¬£18 to almost ¬£30. In other words, penalising a loyal customer. I suspect it's all based overseas: UK legislation states that direct debit customers should be notified of increases. The phone calls to the place cost money. The disability number doesn't work (extra help). They'll be refunding me by the time I've finished with them.

Have had no correspondence from British Gas since they sent us a letter saying our boiler service would be delayed because of covid and that they would contact us when they could fit us in, this was April/ may 2020 which we understood why, we work for social services which requires us to have a regular boiler service, now January 21 just had a renewal from them, we have now cancelled our monthly payment plan, no communication at all, avoid at all costs.

I'm a tenant in fairly old house, so we have had lots of problems with various appliances breaking down since moving in. Luckily our landlords have British Gas Homecare cover, and BG have been unfailingly great for the whole time. Always kind, polite and helpful on the phone, appointments are easy to make and move around, and generally within the next week. Most of the time the issue is fixed first go as well if you describe it in a bit of detail when making the appointment. Can't recommend enough.

British gas have caused us so much stress, anxiety and worry. We joined them for our gas and electric, they setup our direct debit and monthly installments. Was with them for 12 months, our smart meter installation was cancelled because of Covid, had no apology or phone call. No readings were taken over the entire year. Without our knowledge we had signed up to an automatic energy switch company, when our services swapped we then received a final bill and charge from British Gas for over ¬£700. They effectively took away our ability to pay by direct debit and didn‚Äôt manage our account. At no point did we receive communication we were not paying enough each month. Since trying to resolve and get support for the huge bill it has been nothing but stress and impossible to get help. Put on hold for over 30 minutes numerous times, constantly transferred to wrong departments. We can never speak to the right person or speak to anyone who can help, it‚Äôs shambolic. Constantly told someone will call us and never do. Have since raised a complaint, was told would receive a call within 5 days, still waiting two weeks later. We are now getting threatening letters to pay our bill which we can‚Äôt afford. Please don‚Äôt ever use this supplier. We can‚Äôt tell you enough how poor the customer service is and how much worry they have caused us

Absolutely is a waste of time. Almost a year on from my review with British Gas nothing has changed. App constantly needs re installing and takes ages to get it to register my email and new password. Can't tell you how many times I had to get new password link. Gave up after trying for over 2 hours one night till the morning. The balance is still out of date so inaccurate. I am looking into new provider as I can't be bothered wondering whether I'll be able to top up online when I need to the most. British Gas you need to sort out your IT App development.

I understand during this 3rd Lockdown the pressure it has caused but having a frontline Paramedic working during this pandemic to be able to come home early hours in morning to a warm home and hot water o they can shower would be nice. 3 weeks with intermittent working boiler and paying over ¬£882.00 a year to now have to wait another week (which could be rescheduled again) is totally unacceptable.

British Gas have acted appalling towards customers during the UK pandemic. British Gas have hounded customers for payments and threatened the use of debt collection agencies when accounts are a few days old. British Gas has continually breached the government guidelines for utility firms during the national lockdown.

Ofgem should take decisive formal enforcement action owing to the way British Gas has treated customers during the pandemic.

What went wrong ?
What went right ! If an option for 0 stars was allowed , that would be my choice.
Where do we start , ok , we bought a house in October  to do up in Swansea. At this point we had to pop rd and top up the gas / electric in a appropriate shop , and this was rarely easy , to the point I spent all day trying to get a top up , and it actually went dark one day after starting the noble quest to get some power at 10 am . I do not live in Middle Earth B.T.W. This nightmare continued despite numerous unsuccessful contacts with the utter incompetent  so called agents .
Every agent  assured us that the matter would be resolved I think 48 hrs , more like 48 years !
In December British Gas installed a brand new smart meter with top up capability , via the app as the answer to all our problems ,  and it has never worked since installation.
This has left me with the inability to top up my electric, (as I‚Äôm not using gas at the moment).
Despite over 8 hrs of phone calls and countless hours of online chat , the situation has never been resolved .
I‚Äôve been cut off mid phone call several times , and don‚Äôt start with the online chat !
Last attempt 5 minutes ago , on the complaints page , resulted in me getting to the top of the queue , to then be informed that I was in a chat with an agent , only then to be passed to a different agent , this happened 3 times, and then I had the message  NO AGENTS AVAILABLE , at which point the online chat locked out . This was after waiting in the queue for 25 mins .
When I have actually got through , either via phone or chat ,all advice I have been given has proved utterly useless and ineffective, and the issue  has never been resolved and even yesterday evening an agents advice that it would be resolved by this morning has also failed .
A complaint has been lodged with the promise of a phone call back to discuss , and this has never happened either .
ABSOLUTELY USELESS SERVICE ALL ROUND , AND AS FOR  CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!*********
Please heed my review and avoid BRITISH GAS AT ALL COST.

I contacted the BG HomeCare team to report a problem with my heating. My boiler stopped working and as a result I have no heating or hot water in my household.
After listening to their annoying automated chat bot for 5 mins, I managed to get through a representative.
I informed the HomeCare representative that this was an urgent issue as I have family of 5 including children, one of which is under the age of 5 and that I don‚Äôt have any alternative heating options such as a gas-fired fireplace or an electric heater that can my household warm.
Unfortunately, I was told that the earliest possible appointment was 10 days away and that British Gas couldn‚Äôt treat my request as an emergency or urgent because no-one in my household was ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô.  This is a very inhumane and absurd response especially when I have 3 young children under the age of 10.
The customer representative didn't even seem to care about my intention to make a complaint and was laughing when I mentioned that I won't be able to take a bath or shower for 10 days.

I find British Gas‚Äô failure to treat this as an emergency  extremely disappointing given that I am currently paying around over ¬£640 a year for my HomeCare and yet cannot get British Gas to send an engineer in an emergency situation, leaving myself and my family to live in the cold and with limited sanitation (no heating and no hot water!). The Pandemic and lockdown make it extremely difficult to use other means of getting access to hot water such as using a relative‚Äôs facilities, which unfortunately is not an option for my household.

Very upsettting, inhumane, and frustrating indeed.

To speak to anyone on the phone or on-line chat takes well over 30 minutes and in my experience no help has been provided and despite making a formal compliant a simple matter has not been resolved nor has the complaints officer replied to 2 more emails or more complaints.

Firstly, British Gas is totally useless if you manage multiple energy accounts, as they do not allow different supplies to be linked up to one email login. On top of this, I was told I could not discuss an account on which my company is named, and was given the incorrect email address to send a letter of authority to on four occasions by the chat team. They've sent an operative to read meters on our site who's read the wrong meter leading to bills of thousands of pounds that have taken months to remedy. They send notices demanding payment without stipulating which energy account it pertains to. Web chat team are rude and ineffective. Prices are among the highest on the market. In short, the UK's worst company, move any and all accounts you can away from them.

My boiler broke (having been serviced a month ago), in the middle of December. 11 phone calls, 3 engineer visits, 2 appointments where no one showed up and one cancelled appointment later, they still haven't fixed the damn thing. For those keeping count, we're now at two weeks without heating or warm water, and 5 days where I've waited in for an appointment. I genuinely expected better from British Gas (although by the looks of these other reviews, I was wrong to have high hopes). The cherry on top of the cake is paying to call a premium rate phoneline 11 times, and spending 5 minutes going though the same automated voice system each time while they try to avoid actually having to speak to you. It really isn't good enough, I'm hugely disappointed and would strongly advise you look elsewhere for your boiler and heating support. British Gas are not there for you when you need them most.

I don't know what has happened to BG since I was last with them 5 years ago but I have never experienced such an appalling service like I have over the last 4 weeks. Firstly, they tried to bill me a much higher amount which I disputed, but had to consistently contact them about this to get the bill amended. Was told the bill was wrong and it was corrected. Then they wrote me a letter stating I had agreed to pay a weekly amount after arranging to go onto a prepayment meter. I did not agree to anything. So contacted them again to dispute it as well as them adding an amount to the meter which I knew nothing about. I was passed from one person to the next over and over again and passed to a different department that I didn't request. Also left on hold on live chat and phone for nearly 40 minutes to an hour. There are other issues I have encountered that would take to long to go into here but my stress levels have gone through the roof over the weeks I have contacted BG. I have absolutely had enough of them, and now considering changing supplier as they clearly dont care about their customers.

I had a sevicing agreement with British gas.What a joke company?
They failed to service the system properly resulting in several leaks in a short period of time.The engineer failed to check the heating system despite that it is supposed to be checked for safe working order as part of annual service.
This company is a total digrace with a terrible attitude.
Lying cheating scam company
They attended my house agreed with me they at fault in front of 2 witnesses then went back and wrote a report full of lies about the damage their incompetent engineer did.Do not trust them

The customer service do not listen to what you are saying at all, kept trying to send me to a payzone for a new card when i told them repeatedly that i already tried that and our payzones do not stock the cards. Now waiting for an appointment for an engineer via message which i still have not recieved. 46 minutes on the phone to them and what should of been a straight forward conversation has resulted in stress levels through the roof

I don‚Äôt even want to give one star - no option for zero!
I‚Äôve been paying for service care and had ‚Äúannual service‚Äù done by them for a few years. Boiler packed up last week - BG engineer came - messed around with it for a bit, banged the tops of some of my radiator thermostats, and said he‚Äôd send a quote for a necessary ‚Äúpower flush‚Äù. Charge of ¬£60. Left with boiler sort of working. It stopped again 2 days later. 
This time I called in an independent gasman, as wasn‚Äôt convinced. He took front off boiler - said it looked as though it hadn‚Äôt been properly serviced for years (last ‚Äúdone‚Äù in March) - filthy dirty, a metal plate missing and perished rubber seals. Showed me all this. 
He ordered parts, cleaned it all out and put a cleaning solution in system - left boiler working and said he‚Äôd be back with parts. 
Quote for power flush from BG - ¬£880
Independent said if it‚Äôs nec after new parts - he could do for ¬£350. All been working without the need so far. 
British Gas are a complete rip off and not servicing boilers correctly could surely be dangerous!!
Steer clear is my advice. Needless to say, I have cancelled my agreement.

I received my monthly credit report on 19/12/20.  On the report was a dispute for ¬£56, which did not tally with any recent bills, all of which have been paid on time.  

So I queried this with the customer service team via their chat app, all seemed to be going well until they stated I wasn‚Äôt getting what they were saying, which I was.  They was just not answering my original question.  Which was why had a dispute been raised against my account, they started to get quite  argumentative and said I was being disrespectful, which I wasn‚Äôt.  

The representative was a complete disgrace, after being a customer for over 40 years this is the last straw.

British Gas are a bunch of robbing sharks. I switched the agreement when we moved house and when the policy ended they magic up a figure of supposedly unpaid usage from over the winter (6 months prior). as time had gone by you can neither prove or contest it. And rather get threatened with debt collectors.
So we didn't have a bill in December i paid ¬£50 upfront so the agreement of the outstanding balance ends in November. Well December rolls round, i get verbal confirmation from British gas saying there is nothing owing on the account and i am cancel the direct debit. Upon doing this i then get another threatening letter saying i still owe them another payment!!!!. 
In british gas's infinite wisedom there complaints procedure consists of getting repeated texts and emails saying pay now or we'll take you to court!!! Once again, an energy supplier really proves they are for themselves and not the customer. C*U*N*T*S!!

BG still trying to take money out of my account with no bill, takes multiple attempts to try to get through to a call centre (the line often just cuts out when you're in the queue or goes to some random person's answer machine).

Half hearted service

The worst company I thought was eon but British gas just topped it.

I asked just for boiler cover when I joined about 5 years ago turns out I had the max cover for all this time, basically cover ontop of cover and I have had failed service visits. Your ment to be told what's on offer when you call to set up cover not just flogged the highest cover possible.

I called to get a brake down sorted and it was logged as a service. Had another company came around to quote me on a new boiler not long after the brake down,
he said the cover fell off the front it hadn't been put back properly it was full of dirt and dust he could write his name init. He said he had to fill the pressure up which should of been done. He also said it looks like no one has been for a couple of years.
We paying ¬£50per month for a half hearted service thanks for nothing British gas

British gas advertise they go out their way to look after vulnerable customers, their smart meters are malfunctioning because when vulnerable customers such as my disabled daughter pays a top up sum it does not register on her meter or the small read out remote which stands in her house, she has been left with no electricity at times because of this, when you eventually do! get through to a human being they try to text you a 16 digit code which is very complicated to enter into your smart meter, impossible for a disabled person such as my daughter who cannot even answer her telephone because of her difficulties, I a 75 year old got through after trying numerous numbers and explained the problem which was not the first time, some months ago she had the same issue, the advisor after trying to get me to accept a text with a 16 digit number which no one could deal with I ask her is there not another way to solve this, reluctantly she said I will solve it, within minutes she told me the money my daughter had paid over ¬£67 was now registered on her smart meter so why could she just do that in the first place, British gas already have my daughter down as a vulnerable customer they should have engineers on hand to assist handicapped people when difficulties arise, for such a big concern they are very lacking and should be investigated by a utility ombudsman.

I have been on the phone over an hour and has been the most well wasted time. Problems encounter especially with James from Moving houses

1) I recently moved into my house and I asked them to hand me over my account number so I can go with a provider that give better rates, but it seems that I am stuck at least 10 days without my consent to pay their rates until they need to get all details right. Which is their own logistic way of doing things. Not mine. Why do I have to be stuck with rates I do not want to pay? 

2) I have explained that the current meter read includes consumption of the previous ownership but they mentioned no worries we will now what was the consumption before you moved in. False had to get back on this otherwise I would have expected a higher bill. 

3) Gave them all the reg numbers, codes, bar codes etc from the meter yet they were asking for some that I did not have and told me that is my duty to find the one they were looking for. 

Asked for an email acknowledgement that I have to stay for 10 days with British gas even though I do not want but James did not want to provide this confirmation. Asked then to speak with someone else but refused for the reason that I will be told the same thing. 

Worst ever possible experience.

I'm writing this review on behalf of my mum who does not have the means to post it herself. She is a pensioner in her 70s living in south Cambridgeshire who has had a contract with British Gas to service her boiler for years. She was recently contacted by them to say that they were unable to carry out a service this year. They refunded the money for the service and she found a local accredited tradesman to do the job. He discovered that her Magna Flow filter had not been cleaned for years and was so badly silted up it needed to be replaced. When she checked her records, the BG engineers had ticked the box to say they had cleaned the filter every year. This has clearly not been the case so they have a blatantly lied to a customer and charged her for work they have not carried out. She has complained to BG, but all they will do is offer her a discount for a new service agreement. This is clearly not what she wants as they have done such a poor job. I believe they should compensate her for the new filter at the very least. It is shocking behavior, especially for a company that portrays itself to be warm, trustworthy and reliable.

I was with one of their homecare plan. I booked my annual inspection months ago, on the appointment day I kept receiving messages saying that the engineer is on his way and close 5pm I received a call from someone who claimed to be area despatcher said he is cancelling my appointment. I tried to explain that it is very difficult to take time off for me, he didn't want to know, in a very commanding manner he forced the cancellation on me. They made be wait at home till 5 and cancelled the appointment. The person who cancelled the appointment was not emphatic, sounded argumentative, I was with them for years. I cancelled my membership, put ¬£300 claim for my lost day and suffering, waiting to hear from them. I am with another homecare company now.

BG give great promises, but don't stick to them. Their first priority is getting your money under their belt. I had them for boiler cover. They came in June and were in the house for 3 minutes. Ran up to the boiler while leaving the front door open, looked  at it, slammed the cover shut, ran down the stairs and out again. Didnt service the cooker or check the heaters.    Only after making complaints might they do something. I will never use them again.  Stay away from them. They wanted over ‚Ç¨400 for those services.

I switched to British gas from Npower as BG were offering smart meter and a better deal.  

I was with Npower for 4 years and the final year I was with them my bill was ¬£1600 for the year (gas and electricity).  I was working from home so I expected it to be high.  When I changed to British Gas, I had stopped working from home and was rarely at home.  My bill for the year was estimated around ¬£1400 (based on previous usage from Npower).  I was really surprised that each quarter my DD was increasing!  I couldn't understand this as the smart meter had stopped working and was not giving any type of reading out.  It was not possible to obtain a reading from the electricity box.  When I received my final bill,  for the whole year it was ¬£2400!!!  I worked out the wattage that BG had sent me and it seemed way higher than any year I have lived at this address!  In fact it was almost double one of the years.  I called customer services who agreed it was odd and but could not tell me if it was an estimate or where these figures had come from...I was passed through to various departments and back again because no one could help (or could not be bothered)  then eventually i got cut off!  I called again and again and eventually I gave up!  

I am with a different power company noe and my usage is no where near it was with British Gas!  My bills are lower than ever!  

The smart meter broke and BG deny that it was broken when I had photo evidence to show it was broken.  They are a company I will never ever use again!     Customer service weren't helpful at all.

Don‚Äôt use British Gas. One member of staff claimed they never received my gas reading number and told me I owed over ¬£1000 despite another member of staff saying they had sent someone out to read it and gave me dates they had recieved my reading. Told me debt collectors would come after me if I didn‚Äôt pay it. Claimed I had only paid ¬£180 worth of bills when I had paid over ¬£500. Rude staff. Just appalling service.

My account was paid by direct debit over 3 years for boiler cover and an annual service. The first service was not done during the first year, it was done 3 months into the 2nd year. The 2nd year's boiler service was ignored and never completed - massive breach of contract. The 3rd and final year still no boiler service offered, still waiting on the boiler service for both the 2nd and 3rd year! I phoned BG, they offered me a ¬£65 refund for no boiler service for the 2nd year despite paying over ¬£300 for the service. I was given a date in November 2020 for the 3rd year boiler service and I was ASSURED that this boiler service would be undertaken and not cancelled due to Covid-19 as the account had been paid for at least 2 years with no boiler service. Received numerous texts asking that I cancel Novembers' boiler service and receive a ¬£65 refund again (for another ¬£300 worth of DD's). Every text was declined, I wanted the boiler to be serviced. Then received a phone call this week informing me that the boiler service will be canceled, I argued NO, as I have already waited for 2 years, Requested to speak to a manager only to be declined. Costumer support lady was rude and obnoxious to the point that I ended the call. Complaints over both webchat and telephone are unobtainable as webchat is down constantly and the phone will call will be ended before you reach an operator. absolutely disgusting customer service and to have a company like BG have you pay for a service only to not deliver on the service and ignore you is outright deplorable. STAY AWAY!!

Have a  dual fuel account with British Gas which had a smart meter in the property. The tenants left and the property was empty for 5 weeks. The bill for electricity in a flat was over ¬£250 and gas over 60 in a 5 week period. The call centre is constantly unobtainable (hold times in excess of 30 minutes, but cuts you off before then anyway) so you can not dispute the figures. There is suppose to be a smart meter there, which should accurately give these details to them.

Appalling company avoid at all costs.

Cannot believe how such a sham company getaway with how they sell their products or treat their customers.  Bunch of liars. They signed me up promising cheap rates for my business over the phone and clearly quoted me a monthly bill figure which they knew was false as they had been supplying to the same business the previous year and I was just buying it and keeping same energy supplier. Once my first month bill came I knew they had deliberately put a lower estimate on the businesses consumption to show a low monthly cost when quoting me. The bill was more than double what I was quoted I would expect. And worse, they told me when signing that there wont be any cooling off period as it was a special offer and I am accepting as such. Couldnt believe that after months of wrangling and complaints they actually tried to put the blame on me our volume of usage etc. Finally I am kicking them out and NEVER AGAIN BRITISH GAS

The engineer didn‚Äôt turn up for a booked repair. The repair was bumped 7 days ahead. BG‚Äôs response was to advise me to find my own engineer which they would refund. The whole point of having insurance is that the insurer deals with everything. I was also offered ¬£20 compensation. The next day a manager phoned and insisted that I close my complaint. When I refused, he told me the first person I spoke to should not have offered the ¬£20 and he was ‚Äòtaking it off the table‚Äô. 
This is the service and attitude you get when you renew your policy year after year, and spend thousands with them on a new boiler. It‚Äôs their right to bump your job off the list, with not so much as a phone call. You, the customer, are expected to do all the running around, and if you try to escalate a complaint, your compensation offer is withdrawn.
Good luck if you decide to buy cover from this company.

Had a British gas plumber at my house today and his behaviour towards my wife is highly worrying, unprofessional and  threatening.

Had to rush myself back from work for safety reasons. After watching the threatening behaviour of the allocated plumber on the  video clip on my wife's phone, I had no choice but to launch a complaint to British gas and also considering going further to other relevant departments.
unfortunately, he's caused more damage to the bathroom. have to be professional at this point and allow British gas to carry out their internal investigation before I move to the next stage.

British Gas has lied to me, I‚Äôve got homecare cover which is useless. I booked a safety inspection for my boiler in September for November as my family‚Äôs safety is my main priority, in October they sent me 2 separate txt messages bribing me with ¬£65 if I cancelled and rescheduled in May 2021. Now my safety check is way overdue I‚Äôm talking over 12 months so I declined, then last night I received a voicemail telling me appointment had been cancelled anyway ? So they had NO intention of coming out to my property way back in October when they sent me the txt messages. They have really let me down and I have now cancelled my policy as it‚Äôs worthless, local gas service engineers are booked up so my boiler safety check will have to wait longer now putting my family at risk. AVOID this company as they will gladly take your premium each month but will have NO intention of fulfilling the agreement. Best to use a local company

I‚Äôve been paying for Homecare service contract for my central heating - currently ¬£50+ a month. On Friday our boiler stopped working so I rang to request an engineer. Had to hang on phone for ages , and finally got through to Indian call centre and communication was difficult. Finally was given an appointment for following day. When engineer came he advised that unable to obtain part required for repair so left without heating. He told me they don‚Äôt install warm air boilers which ours is! So we have been paying for a service they can‚Äôt provide and we have no heating. I was 31st in queue for phone chat today to make complaint and request payments refund. Finally got through and was told no refund as they can‚Äôt repair if they can‚Äôt get parts! So I‚Äôve been paying for years for nothing!

If I could give no stars to British Gas I would; I previously paid ¬£67 a month for my gas and electricity with British Gas . The new contract indicated a huge increase . I changed to a new supplier and informed British Gas. Subsequently they took ¬£127 out of my account they then said I owe ¬£84 and now they‚Äôve sent me a letter from a debt collectors agency saying I hope ¬£284.47 how can they pluck figures out of the air. I close my account in August so these are bills for summer months  British Gas used to be a reputable company but they are no longer!

Firstly - I know posting a bad review is a waste of time, in so much as this company NEVER positively or honestly replies to messages, emails or letters. 
However I hope that by posting I can stop some other poor unsuspecting person from being stressed out by dealing with this company. I cancelled my homecare agreement as I was moving home and no longer needed the policy. The premiums were paid from a bill paying account and as such was very rarely looked at and we only received annual statements. Upon examining the statement we found that the agreement hadn't been cancelled and we were due a refund of well in excess of ¬£300. Despite having this information in writing, British Gas are deliberately taking their time to process the refund. It's now 10 weeks and counting since we were advised of the refund.

Do not join British Gas. 

Why?

1) Increased my bills from Winter through Spring into Summer, even though I was using less energy (as we all do, due to it being warmer).  Still waiting for a reply to my complaint on that one.
2) When I closed my account they did not even bother to update my bills with a final bill - the last bill showing in my account online is May 2020!  So I don't know where I am with to see if anything else needs to be challenged.
3) Wanted to cancel my Home Cover with them, but you can't cancel easily (why not!?) but have to chat to someone online or by phone.  Oh, but online chat is unavailable and the phones lines are impossible to through on.
4) Finally, a small thing comparatively, but their website is slow and badly designed.

So, I will never switch to British gas again.  It seems that it is often the case these that being a big company means being a bad one - too big to care, to big to be troubled if they alienate a few (thousand it seems) customers.

I changed my home care on there app as I was invited to because they had offered me a better price and I logged into my account and made the change to the next level of cover without any problems and they confirmed by email I was covered however after about 2 weeks my new contact had not arrived and I checked my account via the app it still showing my old level of cover so I tried to contact them and after calling 3 times each time holding on upwards of between 20 to 35 minutes I spoke to an agent who confirmed that change had not been made and actually I was not able to make a change by there app as an existing customer and that the offer was for new customers and the price for me would be additional increase off ¬£12.68 a month on top of the ¬£17.10 that I had been paying.
I find that ridiculous that after been sent email confirmation to be told that and also having to have made change via my account it had been accepted and confirmed that this should be the case, so I asked for my account to be changed back to my original cover and the agent said it‚Äôs not been changed so that was that so I thought!
Next thing I know my account on the app was changed for the higher price with a ¬£60 excess added on.
So I had to start calling again and after 4 days it was changed back.

Shoddy communication from Day 1, no confirmation of opening reads, told would be billed quarterly, then when I chased bill, told it was six monthly.  Had to provide opening read three times, and not acknowledged or registered.  Then received bill for 16 days of gas in a 3 month period, and nothing for Electric.  They haven't a clue what they are doing, app is useless.  Even though cheaper than OVO, i wish I'd never switched, OVO is streets ahead.  I can't stand Ineptitude.

We joined BG in May ‚Äò19 and the first seven months seemed fine. Around Xmas they began doubling the monthly DD without writing, or writing and confirming a lower amount. I reclaimed and paid manually to protect my mortgage payments. Battled on to correct estimated start readings. Maintained original payment schedule and initiated leaving early June with a modest credit on the accounts.

Received three bills in mid July (after account closure) claiming I owed ¬£154, then ¬£194, then ¬£249. On receipt of first bill, asked BG to prove the debt. Despite regular contact and repeated requests, it failed to do so. In Sept, BG placed 3 late markers on my credit file for the disputed debts (2 gas and 1 electricity), which has derailed an ongoing mortgage application.

Raised a claim with ombudsman and discovered that BG had placed us on the standard (most expensive) tariff and backdated this to January, that BG had also increased the debt to ¬£336 added an additional ¬£28 ‚Äòdebt recovery fee‚Äô and forwarded to a debt collection agency during investigation by the ombudsman. This is contrary to FCA sourcebook guidance. I have received no justification for the increases after account closure.

The markers have reduced my mortgage offer by ¬£80k-¬£100k and forced us to radically downscale our aspirations. Instead of looking forward to buying our dream home with our two small children we‚Äôre are struggling to raise enough to even remortgage our current home!

Even after being forced to pay hundreds of pounds in disputed debt in full (on a without-prejudice basis) to its debt collection agency, British Gas refuses to remove the late markers. After following BGs advice to escalate to the ombudsman, BG refuses to speak to/correspond with me on the matter. I am left hundreds of pound out of pocket and essentially unmortgagable!

Taking out a British Gas contract ranks amongst the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to state that British Gas have ruined my family's dreams!

COME ON, British Gas, do the right thing and remove the late markers. Don't punish my children for the dispute you have with me!

Final bill with BG was incorrect. Been going on for 6 months now and I have proved beyond reasonable doubt they have charged around ¬£80 in excess of what it should be. No response other than threats from the company. Their dedicated complaints line is not monitored and leads to FAQs only. Thought Ombudsman might help to get BG to at least look at the issue but frankly O behave like a subsid of BG. Instant denial is the tactic used. Problem what problem ?

Nearly a year ago, I took over the gas meter as new owner. After a few weeks it was evident that it was not working - it was not moving forward (later turned out to be intermittently faultily moving forward). Very obviously not measuring my gas useage. It took hours and hours and hours and extreme stress to me to communicate this simple matter to British Gas. Eventually on not getting through I used the transcript. The experience was as of talking with five year olds (who would have done infinately better than they). They kept turning the conversation circular without any action for me to take and absolutely no comprehension that my gas meter was not working. I have a copy of the transcript. Unbelievable. They lost my business because I went to a cheaper deal and much better service but also of course because of this. They ended up resolving the meter problem by not acting on it, but passing it on to the next company and reducing my final bill to ¬£5 (very worryingly expensive for all if this is how they do business - just write things off - even over a very simple matter. An embarrassment to Britain. They would not even write to say that they had learned from it and properly sorry in that way. Very vague about it. Then in the last few weeks because I have my boiler warranty with their other wing I had to discuss my warranty. Again - two operatives were insistent on giving me the wrong information and sounded very disinterested. Eventually they acknowledged that what they were saying was incorrect and that my information in writing from them was the correct version. Shame on the managing directors of British Gas for not caring for, investing in, training up, empowering, giving autonomy to their front line staff. Very bad.

British Gas has lost its way:
in the past 2 years I have problems on line paying my gas bills, there was always a problem. 
My most recent last sat 10/10/20 I entered my meter readings and shortly after that rI received notification of the bill for my electricity and gas.
I followed  the process of entering my card details only for a message to tell me my card had not been accepted, 5 minutes later I received a message from my bank telling me that ¬£144.40 had been requested by British Gas and for me to confirm this.

A few minutes later I called the number on one of my bills 0800 107 0224  only to be advised that this line is not now in operation and to call 03332029802. Being cautious I checked this number on BT and was advised the number was unsafe and located in France.. I tried several other numbers with out success. 
I emailed customer services and for some reason the email address would not allow me to put a a heading for the subject of my email!!!  so I sent it without a heading. Guess what!  my email came straight back to me!!   

I manage  a complex that houses retired residents and many do not have computers so it is hard for them to contact BG. many of their bills are sky high with one elderly chap paying monthly ¬£117.00 for a  all electric 1 bed flat and BG take  his money on time despite his  emails asking for justification for such high bills. 
Many of my resident's are going off direct debit and paying quarterly and their bulls have almost halved but they are finding it difficult to get back their debit over payments. How ever they feel Paying quarterly by cheque  etc they are in control.   
BG will shortly be losing customers from my complex including me. Awful, awful service and difficult to contact.  I have given 1 x star but only because other wise  I wouldn't be able to get on this site. So BG from me and my residents a zero stare rating.

Terrible company!! Changed from prepayment meters in August. Set up monthly payments and they still haven't sorted the issue. Just a change over thats all!!!! I have spoken to at least 20 agents, had 2 engineers out. Not one person has helped rectify problem. They either put down or pass you onto another department. I am disabled and have in the past 2 weeks been without gas and electric on 3 different occasions. I can't stop crying as I wait upto an hour to call to then be passed onto another department, then the line goes dead. I literally have no gas this morning again. I am cold, I am crying as I am so frustrated. I have been so poorly since the first time I had no gas or electric. I have no where else to go as my family live far away, so I'm stuck in a house cold. I really want to take this further, I've put in complaints but nobody does anything about it. I just don't know what to do.

Every time I have to contact British Gas, I spend on average 45 minutes or more on hold just to get through to a human being, and as soon as I'm put through the call is cut off. Their people never call back so I have to go through the whole 45-minute wait again. I've had multiple engineer appointments cancelled without notifying me, leaving me waiting in all day for someone who was never going to arrive, and no apology at all when I called to complain. At every turn they have displayed incompetence, disinterest and a complete lack of customer care.

I've had nothing but problems with British Gas since I moved into my current property and I've been trying to get these problems sorted for months now with nothing but poor service and absolute failure to communicate on their end. I can't change supplier until the problems are resolved, and they are actively hindering my ability to leave them and sign up with another energy provider. I feel like I'm being held hostage, and continuing to be forced to pay them for the privilege.

Moreover, I can't even top up my gas meter! Since they won't fix the issues, they no longer take Paypoint, and I cannot drive, there is nowhere within reachable distance where I can top up my card. So they're even making it virtually impossible to access one of the services I'm paying them to provide!

Anyone reading this - good god, don't go with British Gas. They're the most atrocious energy supplier I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with and I can't wait to get away from them. 0/10, absolutely will not be using them again, and if I could give a star level in the negatives I would. Their so-called ""service"" is appalling.

Also, fair warning, their customer service representatives are rude, unhelpful and will hang up on you for asking them (politely) to log a complaint.

Moved house recently and had British Gas for gas and electricity at old house, but to avoid hassle decided to keep the supplier already supplying new house and then decide whether to change or not and informed British Gas of decision. Anyway British Gas charged for the correct reading of gas but a higher than actual reading for electric, and also continued to take more payments from account, so I contacted them and was told would be reimbursed for overcharging and additional payments within 10 working days and would receive letter and cheque for overcharging and overpayment but received nothing, I have contacted them again and have been told again that I will be reimbursed, will wait and see hoping I do not have to contact them again  but if I had not checked I would have lost money, over ¬£500, and not been aware of the fact.

After reading the problems some people are having this may seem trivial but why can‚Äôt HomeCare get their act together?  My washing machine broke down on 21 September and the earliest date I was given for an engineer to call was 9 October. 18 days!  Ridiculous.  I rang again at 7.30am on 28th to see if there was an earlier appointment and was told an engineer could come that morning.  He was here by 9.20am.  He had to send for a part and said it would be 7-10 days.  This morning, 5 October I rang at 8am to see what the situation was and was told the engineer would be with me this morning and I should have been notified.  Again he arrived around 9.20 and the machine was thankfully fixed by 10.  If I hadn‚Äôt have been proactive I would still have been waiting for a first visit by an engineer, then there would have been another week for the part.  I told this to the engineer and he said sometimes they don‚Äôt have a full sheet for the day but he goes to someone later in the week who has been waiting ages.  Really it‚Äôs time British Gas got their administration sorted out.  I wrote snail mail to the MD when I was first told I had an 18 day wait saying this was unacceptable but I haven‚Äôt had a reply.  I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

Due to an error on their side I keep receiving bills from British gas for an electric meter that is not mine/ located at my address. I have made them aware of this several times however they keep sending me messages and threatening legal action for overdue bills. They should not even be my supplier as I switched my service to EDF. If I was looking for a new energy supplier I wouldn't even consider British gas.

Terrible Company - they cannot get the bill right even with smart meters.  After moving to the year ago, I had 4 months of constant phone calls, chats and emails to get them to understand that I did have smart meters fitted (that they fitted!) The still insisted on billing me with incorrect estimates and meter readings from another meter that didn't even exist, I had to take several days off work to wait in for engineers to come and rectify the problem - one of which did not turn up and 1 turned up at 9 am when I was told 2 pm.  When they did arrive they simply said - you already have smart meters so what's the problem!! The problem is British Gas have got no idea what they are doing.  No apology or compensation offered and now you cannot even get hold of them at all (Due to COVID, just another excuse).  I will NEVER use them again and have arranged for other members of my family to do the same.  Just on one final point the website and app are terrible and do not give you any information at all (When they are working or displaying proplery that is)

We received a letter from British Gas confirming our appointment for a ""Gas Safety Check""
We were given a five hour slot and even had a text message that morning saying everything was good and on schedule.
Waited in all day!  no engineer turns up and no text messages or calls to notify us.
Tried ""writing"" two weeks still no reply
Tried ""live chat"" sorry no record of appointment
Tried ""email"" sorry e mails are not being monitored
Tried ""calling""  after 50 minutes and being transferred several times we eventually found out they had actually received the original complaint letter and are dealing with it, but never thought to tell?
This  appointment was made for a (Gas Safety Check) and we are actually registered on the British gas support scheme for vulnerable/priority customers.

would give a negative number if I could. Trying to change from British gas to another supplier. The change was supposed to happen at the beginning of September, but they won`t allow it to go ahead as they say I have a debt. I don`t, it was the previous tenant. I actually have my webchat transcript saying this but I received a letter this morning saying the transfer is on hold due to a debt. This apparently is all due to a computer glitch, I have had 7 web chats several phone calls and have written several complaint letters, all to no avail. I would like an apology and acknowledgement that the debt was never mine to begin with, And some recompense for phone bills and stress caused. I live in hope

I made a Complaint regarding the failure of British Gas Home Serve to repair my central hearing system, through Resolver.  They responded very quickly, arranged an engineer to come out, when four days before, there were no appointments.  Well done Resolver.  I was offered, a good well gesture of ¬£30. Told and confirmed in writing a bank transfer would be made, within 14 days. The 14 days was specific, not working days, but 14 days.

I allowed 14 working days.  No bank transfer was made. I went back to Resolver (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and British Gas told me to contact them, which I did this morning (24.09.20).  I was told a cheque was issued on the 9th September 20020.

A cheque is not a bank transfer. There is a distinguishable difference between a cheque and a bank transfer.

I was told the cheque could take unto 14 working days.  If a cheque is not received within that timescale I will contact the Ombudsman.

I do feel the Customer Service person I spoke to should  have apologised on behalf of her colleague, as he misled me.  May not wilfully but clearly does not know how British Gas work.

As we are in a COVID-19 situation, I am being put at risk, as I will have to make an unnecessary journey to a bank.

Clearly diminishes the value of the gesture.

Thank you British Gas for poor customer service.

As a single mother with a 2 year old on benefits and living in a one bedroom flat, they would charge me ¬£300 per month for a property using only electricity. We barely used the tv, heating or even cooked just to save on energy and they still kept up the high charges each month. I called them to discuss with them so many times every year that there was absolutely no way we could be using that much energy but they refused to lower the amount. Finally after two years I was forced to move on from them. I arranged to pay off my outstanding balance with them monthly but during the Coronavirus lockdown they transferred my balance to the Morcroft group debt collection agency, permanently ruining my credit score for the next 7 years. I was also a full time student during this time so I‚Äôm unable to get a credit card to help improve my score. British Gas is a lying and cheating energy supplier that rob the poor of any financial stability. I hope every one working for them goes to Hell. I now warn people about to move into new properties and other students about there greedy tyranny.  I hope the CEO gets the coronavirus virus or some kind of horrible illness.

Absolutely ridiculous. For a company that pretty much represent England when it comes to gas and electricity.  I expected way more. Customer services is appalling and disgraceful. While some have been a bit helpful others have been woefully appalling.

Journey started 9months again when I moved into my new build.  Building site already pre registered with British gas. British gas sends me numerous letter saying I owe this and I owe that. To which I called to set up a direct debit for both bills.  

2 days later I got an email to say direct debit was cancelled when I did not cancel it and bill was not even yet to be taken out. I called again. Spent almost 2 hours trying to get through. Eventually did. Spoke for few minutes. Phone hang up or they hang up and I was expecting a call back to which no one did. Called back the second day. Similar waiting hours. Set up direct debit again. Again 2 days later it was cancelled. 

At this stage I just left left the DD options and pay online. Electricity seems to have been set up (on a wrong plan) but at least I was getting billed and making a payment. Gas on the other hand was a joke. It would seems this was never set up correctly even though I was promised this is the case. Every time I tried to make a payment. It would tell me I have zero balance to pay.

It took months of calling and after 6 and half months I was finally billed almost 400 pounds. This was Covid time and a bad timing. I called again explaining this is ridiculous and not my fault and at this stage. I had been charged late payment fee. I called explaining my case and it took almost 20 min before customer service understand what I am explained to him. Waived the fee. Opened a complaint and advised someone will get in contact with me 

Someone finally back to me from the complaints team. We agreed that he would put me on my original plan from when I moved in. Set up a DD for both accounts. Ring me back and advise the new bill amount and let me make a decision if I still want to stay or not. A month after the call. Got an email that DD was set up. And this is my bill. Also got an alert from Equifax that has and electricity added to my account. He also advised a hold will be out on my account until he calls me back for me to make a decision (this was not the case)

I texted (he advised that I could do this) this individual that why has he gone ahead and put this in place without my go ahead to which no reply. I called customer service to which an email was sent to same individual that I had an agreement with his manager CC'ed in. Considering my frustration at this stage. I was promised a manager would call me back within 2 hours. Waited whole day. No call. I also asked if my complaints was still active to which he advised this is the case

I called back the second day. While expressing my frustration. Customer service hang up on me even though I apologise at the beginning of the call that I might sound upset. I was expecting a call back to which I never got back. I called back and this time speaking to a nicer lady. Explained my situation again. While she was a lot nicer. I found I have to repeat my self numerous times as it would seems no attention was given to what I was saying. I asked about my complaints and she advised me this is now closed. I told her I was told otherwise the previous day. 

Anyways to cut long story short. I was advised a manager by the name Dominic will call me back again that day without failing. Again waiting whole day with no one calling me back. 

On top of that a missed payments notification has gone on my record when this is not my fault. 

Absolutely disgusting, disgraceful and British services should be ashamed. 

At the stage. I have had enough. Just wanna get this sorted and leave

Appalling customer service. Trying to change from British Gas, due to a previous complaint, electric side done no problem, but the gas side well that's a different matter. They claim I owe them money. I don't  as it is from the previous tenant 5 years ago, which to my knowledge was sorted out 5 years ago as they refunded me the money taken off for the debt. I have been on the online chat on 4 separate occasions just to be told to call a number, you call that number and are told to call another number, and then was cut off. I also requested the transcripts from my online chats and they were never received. So now I am going to the ombudsmen.

Looks like our complaint is going to be similar to all of the complaints below.

We have spent more then 10+hrs on the phone to British Gas in order to get incorrect billing sorted.
When we first moved into our flat they tried to charge us ¬£1500 for 2 days of electricity, we eventually had this rectified after months of calling.

Our smart meter hasn't been working since we moved into the property but yet ""readings"" have been taken every month by BG
We switched to Octopus Energy (highly recommend) and our DD with them is ¬£35 with manual meter readings taken monthly - amazingly we are actually in credit with these guys after a few months, probably because their readings are accurate
Pretty obvious to us now that BG have been doing a bit of guesstimation/how much can we con people out of with their ""smart meter"" readings.

We have continuously been cut off on the phone when we mention OFGEM and complaint - firstly by Kim, then Cleo in billings and then by a different Kim.
It's incredible though that your ""debt collectors"" (who are just still British Gas) are able to harrass us nearly every day of the week.

We will absolutely not be paying any further money to British Gas and have raised this with OFGEM

Our customer number is: 851014685415

Looks like our complaint is going to be similar to the various complaints below.

We spent 10+ hours total now on the phone to British Gas with the phone constantly getting cut off by each individual the minute that complaint and Ofgem are mentioned - this happening with Kim, then Cleo in billings and then a different Kim.

When we initially moved into our property they tried to say our bill was ¬£1500 for 2 days of electricity - it took us months to get this reversed.
Our smart meter has been broken since we moved in, but amazingly they have been able to take readings from it - no reading has ever been asked for manually.
We switched to Octopus Energy (highly recommend) and our readings are taken manually every month, and lo and behold our monthly DD is only ¬£35 compared to BG who were trying to say it was ¬£130+ from their smart meter readings.

Sent us to a debt collection company (who is just them) and have been harassing us every single day with emails and phone calls - incredible how they can managed this contact but when we needed to speak to them it takes literally hours on the phone to be passed in circles by incompetent staff. 

We will absolutely not be paying the money they are claiming we owe and will be going to Ofgem in order to have this sorted.

Our customer reference number is:
851014685415.

p.s in the time my partner has been waiting for your staff to raise a complaint on your end (36 minutes so far), I've managed to write and post this - urgency is definitely not of the essence unless of course they are harassing you for money.

Completely agree with the negative reviews about people's experiences. Moved to BG in August, which I'm already regretting: (i) BG gave the incorrect final meter readings to my old supplier, so my final bill is much higher than it should be. Not clear how they can mix up 5 numbers in that way, and (2) my account is still not linked to the correct address despite telephoning customer service on the day i transferred. I think the message is very clear AVOID any hassles and whatever you do, DON'T CHOOSE British Gas!!!

I moved into a property, I was told I was with british gas (prepared meters) . I have never worked with these before, so I requested for them to be changed to credit meters. After 10 failed calls and being cut off. I was told this wasn't an option. I had to wait 28  days from being in the property, then I was only able to change to credit meters after a smart meter was installed. So after 28 days, I booked in to get a smart meter installed, taking a day off work for this. The engineer comes, after 2 seconds he tells me a smart meter can't be installed in my propeety because of where my meters are, and that it is on the system for this house that a smart meter can't be installed. Totally wasted my time. I since left British gas after a month, now I receive an energy bill from them, even though I used prepared meters, for a month. Absolutely useless company. Don't even bother trying to ring customer services, you're on hold for hours and you get cut off and no one bothers to call you back. Not to mention you get letters EVERY SINGLE DAY sent to you.

Been trying to call British gas for 2 days.  First time 1 and a half hours waiting for them to answer. To be cut off and an hour waiting next day.  They took money out of an old account. Not used anymore.  And the bank charged me an unauthorised overdraft fee . I'm not computer literate. I don't own a computer  and there's no option on the useless app. They have  so I have to speak to someone   . Worst company ive ever come across

I have tried many times to get in touch with british gas to change from payg to direct debit. i have called them three different times on 'priority numbers' the chat service has given me. First time I was on hold for an hour before they hung up, second time it was two hours before they hung up. I am currently an hour and a half into the third call...still nothing. Tried to resolve this with the chat function. They just kept telling me to try again. I asked for someone to call me back.He said that wasnt possible. I asked to escalate this to a manager. He told me due to covid-19 there are no managers. He gave me another priority number to call (which I am on hold to know). When I asked how this number was different to the others he ended the chat. If they are going to hang up on me again I'm going to just switch suppliers.

If you are thinking about switching to BG I would think twice about it. Have been with them for 40+ years mainly prepayment meters. During Covid have kept my gas topped up in case I can't get out for awhile. I had a problem with the meter and after a day or so managed to get a engineer out it said on the screen battery fail I've had this problem before and the usually they put in a new battery. This time he said they are not allowed to do that now but have to put in a new meter as I had ¬£80 still in the meter I asked could he transfer it but was told he would make a note about it and phone tomorrow. There was also ¬£30 on the card so a total of ¬£110.when I phoned was told that I had to pay ¬£190 for the meter something I didn't want or ask for still trying to sort out my refund I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they would ring me back I still haven't managed to get a card for it no one has phoned back and tired to phone them was told it would take 45min was on the phone waiting for 1 hour and 39 min got through and the line went dead got to do it all again tomorrow to sort this problem No customer care and have taken my money put in for warmth this winter And I'm angry

British Gas Home Service does not do what they imply in their adverse.  Ten days for an engineer to sort out why our central heating does not work. The best that they can do is offer an electric heater, well we need one in the bathroom (not a good idea) two for each bedroom, two for the front and rear reception rooms and one for the kitchen.  Can't see that happening. Left a poor review yesterday, which has been verified but not as far as I can see published. We are a vulnerable couple, but safeguarding is not high on British Gas' priority.  We have borrowed a heater, rather than have an electric blow heater which costs a fortune to run. ¬£272 per annum, goes up every year, have not made a claim in nine years, have to pay a ¬£60 excess but still ten days waiting.  They don't deserve the one star.  The largest big supplier they have the largest poor performance to match

We pay ¬£272 for full home care cover.  In addition we have to pay a  ¬£60 excess on every job requiring a repair.  If we do have a repair in one year of cover the price of the policy still goes up.  No discount for not making a claim.  Currently, we have no central heating.  While British Gas engineers are looking after new customers who are offered ¬£40 cash back we will have to wait ten days for an engineer to resolve the loss of central heating.  Ten  days for an engineer to come out is appalling.  We are vunerable and all Britsh Gas offer is a heater.  Cannot put this down to COVID-91 but looking after new customers and giving them ¬£40.. . No heating, and we are vulnerable and some nights are cold.  Been using British Gas home service since it first started, a life time. To add insult to injury, British Gas does not trust its customers and wants the excess up front.  We will borrow a heater from family, don't want to trouble British Gas.  When the contract ends so does my loyalty to British Gas and I will join Homeserve.

Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened to BG Home Care. We‚Äôve been with them for a number of years, transferring from their main competitor. Things were great until last year and dire, this year. Annual boiler service used to be booked automatically by THEM and you got the choice to change the date if unsuitable; no more since last year and it‚Äôs worsened. Indeed, I‚Äôve spent more than two weeks trying to speak to a human being without success. Their App doesn‚Äôt work; their website tells me there‚Äôs an error, their chat/text messaging service tells me they can‚Äôt get into my account, that I appear deregistered and for me to request a login link. Did so and still received an error message. (Grr!) Got fed up and rang them and still wasn‚Äôt able to speak to a human being! Managed though to book an annual service with an automated system. I still need a plumber to come out to fix a leak! Booking an engineer shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult. It‚Äôs sad that the booking process is painful- makes me wonder if they‚Äôre trying to take your money without offering the service. That said, I should add that most of their technicians who‚Äôve fixed things in the past have done so effectively  - for us, it‚Äôs just been the booking system and the ridiculous ever increasing cost and roulette they play with your package.

Absolutely awful service. I am extremely annoyed having paid for home care for years. No hot water for over a week and faulty boiler . Despite promises to come and sort out the emergency I am still waiting. Appointments are cancelled last minute. It is impossible to speak to a human being except when I have to reschedule an appointment that British Gas cannot make. Of course the person cannot answer any queries and is only able to apologise. I am wondering why I am payi for such shoddy service. This whole situation is making me ill.

We had a new boiler from British gas installed December 2019, 8 months ago, it has now stopped working!!!! we have been homecare customers for 20+years, automated service offered earliest appointment for an engineer on 7 September,  9 days without hot water and any heat!!!! As my husband has serious health issues we now have an appointment tonight, anytime up to 0600 tomorrow morning, I am beyond speechless at this shockingly bad service, I also expected a new boiler costing thousands of pounds to not break down after 8 months!!! Am currently looking for someone else to supply a more reliable boiler insurance, our annual service should have been carried out in may but due to covid wasn't.

Bunch of unprofessional people. It is in the fabric and DNA of the British Gas (HomeCare) team to let people down. When it comes to making money they are most professional and taking the credit card details, they don't delay at all (Greedy company, greedy management). I am surprised this company is still trading. 2nd time I have been let down. The first time it took a few days to resolve the appointment and today at the end of the day, I get a call from to say engineers won't attend because they are busy. They can't even guarantee that the next slot on Wednesday is guaranteed.

This company is seriously a black mark and plague on professionalism on ""British Brand"" less than 50% satisfied customers. Says everything about them. I just hope they shut down for good and by doing that they will do a great service for the British public

Set up an account all good then didn‚Äôt get a bill for 2 months so called to find out what was going on as it was set up to be direct debit monthly was told issues with account 8 months later the account finally received a bill for the entire year showing March and April usage at around ¬£300 cheaper each month to the bill was then informed this was because no monthly bills had been taken despite having set it up and calling to fix it. Now almost a year later still trying to stop them charging me extra for not making monthly payments when it was their mistake and fault. Awful company, misinformation spread like wildfire. Was told I could get telephone transcripts from October in July when I called (And was told they‚Äôd be done whenever the manager got round to it which is great)only to then wait 2 And a half weeks contacting about where my transcripts were to be sent to a different department who immediately told me the transcripts weren‚Äôt available and are deleted after 90 days conveniently deleting evidence against them and wasting my time speaking to multiple British Gas employees chasing these transcripts.

I pay for an annual service/maintenance call due Feb.20. Unfortunately due to covid BG could not attend. Rang end May regarding this visit and told would be coming. Rang again June and said when was my maintenance going to happen as I could smell soop. They took the details and stated the costs, I said that as I had a contract they was no costs. Long story short I received an invoice and maintenance visit was not carried out. The story goes from bad to worse. Spoke to customer service who stated that the invoice was correct. I sent my complaint to the COE, not acknowledge by him , then had it referred back  to customer service. Customer service sent me an email asking me what the issue was. (I had attached this to my e-mail ((to CEO)) all details. Since then I have had two demands for payment, together with other emails. Today I have spent over 2 hours on the phone and web chat and got absolutely nowhere. Told in email to contact Ofgen. Could go on but I'm sure you know where this is going.

They were supplying energy to the flat I moved to, so I just decided to stick with them. BIG MISTAKE
After  paying electricity for almost 4 years all of a sudden my account was closed and not long after I received a bill for almost ¬£3800 for a month! This was obviously a mistake, so I tried to contact them just to received an unbelievable response from them. They said ""someone had registered my meter by mistake and updated the reading,"". They said they would fix this.
Well, it's been three months now. I have received threatening emails saying they will send my details to a debts collection agency if they don't hear from me. I have contacted them 6 times!

Good morning 

I wish to complain about the appalling customer service I have had from British Gas.

I have a home 400 service contract (for several years) with additional appliance cover and most recently the grill in my electric cooker stopped working.
I contacted British Gas for an engineer and the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô engineer came to assess. He arranged fora more specific engineer to come and this was arranged between 12-6.
The engineer did not attend despite me taking time off work to wait for his/her visit. I complained via the web chat and a further appointment was arranged for yesterday (26 August) however again a no show and no explanation as to why.

I have taken two afternoons off work and this is completely unacceptable behaviour from any organisation. I want a full written explanation as to how this occurred and what British Gas intends to do to prevent it happening to other customers.

Do not take out a British Gas boiler homecare maintenance plan, some may remember the ‚Äúwatchdog‚Äù programme some years ago - that‚Äôs it‚Äôs merely their ploy to sell new boilers & out of my recent experiences it still definitely is, each time a ‚Äútechnician‚Äù (engineers fix things) visits either for service or breakdown I get the patter about the none availability of parts. What a joke the biggest gas brand in the UK have no leverage, they hike their price by post every year & you can‚Äôt speak to anyone with any knowledge or brains or customer service. Last year they quoted a power flush at ¬£990, so I asked a local expert to do it & he fixed the simple other things wrong with boiler for less than a fifth of that price. When the service came round in Jan 20 - the BG homecare gas technician said what a superbly performing boiler, I had an ignition issue this weekend Aug 20, I called For a homecare appointment - their online account method is rubbish / almost another ploy to prevent your contact.  After their visit yesterday & later in the day, someone called to tell me ‚Äúthe fan part is not on the list‚Äù (well I think that‚Äôs what was said - it was a confusing mumble)... of course the technician‚Äôs friendly approach included ‚Äúyou can get a new boiler from the biggest gas brand in the U.K. for less than the cost of the homecare plan‚Äù. Confirming to me British Gas are continuing in taking money under false pretences, my plan is already over ¬£60/month - they have no intention of fixing older boilers. I‚Äôve had numerous previous rude & aggressive technicians over the years - thinking they know it all. So guess what, I‚Äôm fed up of this useless customer treatment - I‚Äôll be calling the local expert, cancelling this plan after 17 years of very very weak unprofessional service. Oh yes, they‚Äôve quoted ¬£708 for next years homecare maintenance plan, a cost which mostly covers the BG homecare technicians sitting in their expensive vans instead of improving diagnosis & sourcing parts needed for a maintenance plan!! 
My recommendation is - Do not take out British Gas boiler homecare maintenance plan, use a local expert who has the right determination to satisfy you - this lot do not care about you!!!

So my annual boiler service under the Homecare agreement was booked months ago for last Monday, 17 August, (first available appointment) between hours of 8 and 1, but no one turned up. Took me several calls to get thru' to real person after being cut off several times having gone thru' electronic messages. Was told my appointment wasn't for the 17th but 24th. I know it was the 17th as I remembered standing in front of calendar writing it in and saying to myself ""ah, so-and-so's birthday"". So today, 24th, same again, rang, eventually got thru' to a real person after several attempts, to be told they'd call the engineer and I'd receive a call within 15 mins, no such call has been forthcoming - nearly 2 hours now. Have tried to call 3 times again but after the electronic sifting process the call gets cut off repeatedly. FUMING!!

After moving into a new home I had a terrible experience with British Gas.

I was put on a temporary extremely expensive tariff which I wasn't informed of until being in the property for over 3 weeks.

I then received bills requesting I pay for the previous owners gas & electricity usage which they hadn't yet paid. I phoned BG and told them this was not ok and asked them to send amended final bills only for my usage. They agreed it was an error and would send amended bills.

The bills which arrived were still incorrect, this time they had falsely increased meter readinging way beyond when I had switched to a new energy supplier. I have a BG smart meter so it was disgraceful they made up an estimated reading instead of using the smart meter they have access to.

I phoned again requesting up to date correct & final bills. This time the electric bill was correct but wasn't a 'FINAL' bill... and the gas bill was even higher than before...

At this stage they started threatening to send my details to a debt collection agency.

I finally used their live chat and had to be very pushy. They agreed the electric bill should have been a 'final' bill and this was their error, and they agreed the threats were a mistake - yet continued to send them.

Today I finally have written confirmation from them of the correct, final bill amounts which I will pay. avoid this con-men.

Note the written confirmation also included some other customers details and case information by their error - stupid british gas!

Never once in my life felt the need to do one of these. As context there are 2 people living in my house and we use no gas at all and very little electricity (same room same tv short time periods). 
We were paying ¬£130 a month for dual fuel tariff and after reviewing other deals seemed very expensive for what we were using. Turned out British Gas constantly messed around with my payment and stopped it for some months and hiked it up twice as high others, then upon leaving switched me to an ‚Äòemergency plan‚Äô which I assume was to just milk any extra money from me costing me ¬£200 in one month. Received an email stating that a debt collection agency will come to collect if I do not pay, cannot speak to anyone other than outsourced individuals with no power to do anything other than get you off the phone.

We were charged a call out fee for a leak as British Gas claimed we were not covered, despite having Homeware 4 package. British Gas had downgraded our cover without informing us.
Repair completed by cowboy sub-contractor which still leaked and cost us to repair with another plumber.
When engineer later called for annual boiler service he showed us that we were listed on his system as having full cover, even though BG still denied it. 9 months later finally received refund but no apology
Not possible to book annual services when due, and then cancelled at last moment. Friends have had contract for 5 years but only received 4 annual service calls.

Home care policy ¬£109 a month what a farce. 2014 was sold a policy the only reason I agreed to it and took it out was because I was informed that any thing covered that isn‚Äôt repairable will be replaced like for like. I had cause to contact British Gas as my dishwasher has stopped working plus my brushes steel double plug sockets in my kitchen only one side is working on a few so thought might as well get an electrical engineer out to look at them. A rude engineer contacted me on the day asked about the problems. Told me he wouldn‚Äôt do dishwasher as it sounds like an appliance issue and would throw it back to British Gas to sort another engineer to come out. He then went onto to say he would not replace the sockets like for like (which I was told in the beginning it would be) but would be replaced with some old white plastic things they carry in the van if I want brushed steel I need to go and buy them and re book! I went back to work to be told later by my son that an engineer had been out after I left to look at the dishwasher! I contacted British Gas to be spoken to rudely abruptly and quite frankly obnoxiously by a Scottish accented team leader who told me continuously to read the policy document I challenged her and she first agreed she didn‚Äôt always read them herself but later when I used the same statement she accused me of attacking her personally as it now transpired if my dishwasher is repairable it will be but if not the exchange team will contact me to replace the dishwasher LIKE FOR LIKE but if it‚Äôs over three years old I have to foot 70% of the cost of the replacement which is not what I was sold when I agreed to accept the policy. I challenged her about what I get for ¬£109 a month she couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt respond just reverted back to type saying read the policy document and put the phone down after refusing point blank any form of refund or part refund for miso of policy. 
I was neither rude aggressive (well I did have to talk over her as she repeatedly spoke over me when I was talking) or attacked her personally all I did was challenge her on her responses to my questions. This is a policy not worth taking out, not worth the money as there are more disadvantages to it than advantages to having it and if you are told like me like for like its NOT your find not everything is covered so you will be paying twice once for the policy and again for any new appliance or plug face. Very disappointed and disgusted will be cancelling this policy once the dishwasher is done and will replace the plugs myself or get a friend who is a qualified electrician to do it certainly won‚Äôt cost me ¬£7,848.00.

""What Went Wrong""? EVERYTHING!  I am trying to change a pre-payment Electricity meter for my 83 year old father (Who is on the vulnerable sheilding list, so has not been out of the house for over 4 months) He cannot get to a shop to top up the card, and as the system is outdated and expensive he agreed to the change.  Customer service took all his bank payment details for the new Direct Debit Payments, and assured his it would take 48 hours to complete the switch, also to leave the meter by ¬£2 in credit.  4 days later all his Electricity went out.  There was no emergency call number,  by pure chance we managed to get the electricity back up and running 6 hours later.  They hadn't switched the meter at all.

How was the issue resolved?  Let's just say it's on going.  If no one ever getting back to you, or telling you via their on line chats that the meter is with another energey supplier and not British Gas, is on-going!!  Getting through to an actual person is impossible, then it's barking dogs and screaming kids in the back ground.  I feel terrible for my father who has been so patient, I just know that they are going to take the direct debit from his account, and he will still be topping up the meter, and we are then faced with a whole new set of problems.  I feel so angry that they are allowed to treat their most vulnerable and loyal customers this way and just get away with it.

British Gas Homecare. I was a good customer for many years having homecare three. I just looked on a comparison website on the off chance, being furloughed has given me time to really have a look on my outgoings to find I could get home care four cheaper than what I was paying for three as a new customer. My policy was up for renewal soon so I cancelled and took my custom else where. I will look more closely in future.

Promised a discount to prevent me leaving Y,. Energy and held me captive by saying that they would call back.  The discount was never applied, I spoke to 26 ppl,and they regularly left me hanging on the line and cut me off too. The worst customer service in the UK.  Horrendously expensive.  Nothing good to say about them. When I lodged a complaint they scratched it off saying they wanted it closed as they thought they had done enough. Many, many, many companies are much less expensive and head and shoulders over B. Gas to deal with.  Even if you leave you will probably be quids in ....their charges are exorbitant, their staff couldn't care less, case handlers pretend to sort and then ditch,  as they are likely to feel so miserable, dejected and sorry that they ever took a job from these useless Charlatans.

2) Even sometimes you are in middle of conversation, if they knew you are loosing (switching) they will intentionlly hang up (morethan two times)...
2) call again... wait again... even the most disgussing thing with British gas was that sometimes there was female's sexy voice recorded in their waiting tone... Totally disgussing !
3) Once they blocked you to switch to other company, sametime, they will block you to make online account to pay thier bills... because they put us more stress and time waste by call payment.
4) When they knew you are switching, they will switch you to multiple staff. Simply making you give up (more than 6 staffs... prepared to stay with them at least 2 hours)
5) Even you are totally agree to switch to other company... they will not agree with other company for helping to switch you
6) Lastly, there are exceptially expensive.... everyone knows that...

Agree with all reviews. I have wasted hours of my life trying to sort out simple issues. I finally managed to get an engineer to change a prepayment meter to a credit meter at a new property, but the change did not show on the account. I then wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to sort this out and also to change from (expensive) Economy 7 because we removed the old storage heaters. The customer service is atrocious, both on the telephone and on the online Chat system. They agents are not trained, and the system doesn't work. British Gas is now owned by the infamous Centrica, which is interested only in profit. If other reviews are correct, and it is difficult to switch, then I'm not surprised people are driven to the brink of suicide. A truly shocking company to be avoided like the Plague.

Hard to get hold of staff who are inept & inefficient. Totally unable to book a boiler service which was due 6 weeks ago but now they tell me is not due. Last time the ""engineer""clipped a wire around a coil which left the boiler to constantly call for hot water. Was told it was dangerous but ""engineer"" wouldn't come back so had to book another one to correct bad workmanship & no compensation for no heating for 2 days. British Gas used to have such a good reputation but now am totally disillusioned with this ""service"" or rather lack of it.

In the winter our boiler broke down and we were told British Gas could not have someone around because they were too busy for the next three days. Apparently this happens in the winter because of high demand but that is exactly when you need your boiler so what is the point of homecare service agreements?

Now our plumbing has broken down, our kitchen has flooded but when I rang I was told that this was not an emergency and dyno rod  would not be around for two days.When I enquired it comes across as a company with no real service standards defining  emergency as being what they can cope with under the prevailing circumstances. Clearly advertising heavily putting on lots of customers but not staffing up to meet demand properly. Shame on you British Gas for this mediocrity.

Appalling company for Home Care and Customer Service. We moved from British Gas as energy suppliers some time ago but have stayed with them for home care - pay ¬£80/month for water and pipe cover, repair cover for 2 kitchen appliances, plus central heating cover. In this time they have failed to mend appliances on almost every occasion they have been, or we couldn't arrange a visit. 
They could not mend the heating/hot water, so we were without for several weeks, despite 6 visits, even though there was an obvious leak above the boiler FROM THE PUMP, that I had pointed out to the engineers - they told me our roof was leaking. Eventually one engineer sorted it.
We have a pipe leak they have never sorted - it has a tray underneath it to catch the water!
Now during COVID, they take your money but will not visit or refund.
I have finally had enough and cancelled. Just looking at other contracts, almost everyone else has a better review - go elsewhere until they up their game!

I was with British Gas from 2000 for 18 years on both gas & electric. I bought a second house in 2009 to renovating and switched that to British Gas too. In 2011, huge bills started arriving for both properties. I realised that the second property's bill was just an estimate and once I gave correct meter readings to BG, I was hundreds of pounds in credit. I then asked BG to use this credit to clear the bill on the first house, which they did. A few months later another massive bill arrived for the first house and BG took the money automatically. I then realised this was an estimate too! What followed was a campaign of months to get my money back and it was only because of my tenacious nature that I succeeded. I should have left then, but didn't. I sold the first house and went on monthly direct debits for the second. For the next few years a pattern emerged where I would pay ¬£176 a month for about 9 months, then have a meter reading, be told I was over ¬£1000 in deficit, and the bill would go up to ¬£380 a month. The usage was the same, year in year out, so why can't BG estimate a correct monthly debit? I left BG fifteen months ago and have been paying ¬£150 a month to my new company...its late May and I'm ¬£500 in credit - figure that out.

Worst company I have ever come across. I have had nothing but issues since November 2018. Smart meter always messing up 2 people came round and cant fix so I go to update my readings and only let's me do it for gas and not electricity yet my usage is showing as seperate.. then when my bill came in they only counted the gas. No idea how much I owe them now but it's becoming a joke now. Then you go through customer service and it's like talking to a brick wall. Oh and also I booked in a boiler service and months ahead so on the actual day noone turned up they said they sent me a letter to cancel it. I could not believe it and it was 2 weeks before Christmas. They are an absolute joke.

Leak from hot water tank March 29.  6 Attempts to get through by phone, holding on for 20-25 minutes each time until line dropped out.  Tried the online emergency service and was given a date for December 25, 2021.  The next day I received an email saying that the 1st email was sent in error but still no time for an 'emergency engineer'. In desperation I managed to get a plumber through a friend to come out, in spite of lock down, on the afternoon of the 30th.  The water tank was drained and things left secure.  All of this was done remotely as I am trapped outside the country.    As I will likely be able to travel soon I called British Gas, under my homecare contract, to come out and repair/replace.  I was informed that I had to pay the ¬£99 excess call out charge. I said this was unreasonable since I had already paid ¬£140 to get someone out because BG was uncontactable and I didn't want to damage my flat and the flat below with leaking water.  The BG rep remained firm.  I asked to be put through to the complaints section the person at the end told me a ¬£30 reduction was all that she would do because:
   1. I did not try hard enough to contact them (my phone log will demonstrate otherwise) and people were getting through on the day (not this person).
  2. ""It was my decision to call another plumber to save the building from water damage"".

I then asked to be transferred to contract cancellation. The rep duly declared the contract was cancelled and that I would receive an email notification to that effect. 3 days later no confirmation!!   I tried to log into my account to see if there was a message but was locked out because ""I had not been a British Gas customer for 6 months"" !!!?? Interesting in that the contract was only cancelled 3 days ago?

My next step was to use my online banking facility to cancel my direct debit to British Gas for Homecare which I have just done.
My bank suggested I notify you of this  - SO YOU ARE NOW NOTIFIED!
I will not spend any more hours with communication systems and corporate processes that do not work.

Poor customer service staff kept hanging up on me and talking over me when I was trying to explain to them that I was having an issue with topping up basically I have not been able to top up my electricity via their app, online or in store I keep getting error messages on the app, online and on my receipt when I try to top up my key, and this is very frustrating because of the current pandemic. Staff is very rude also I removed gas prepayment from my british gas account last year because I only use electricity (because all my appliances are electric and so is my shower) then they put gas back on my account with out my knowledge even though this was supposed to have been removed since last year when I call them they give me the run around and it is very hard to get through to them I literally have to say I have a problem with my cooker even though I don‚Äôt on the phone in order to get through to someone otherwise the phone will give message about covid 19 vulnerable customers need help then it will cut. I have been saying I have problem with cooker so someone will pick up the phone then I tell them the real problem and I have to wait to be put through to the correct department and a lot of times they either cut the phone, do not solve the issue or are just plain rude.

Had a boiler overpressure issue, 1.2 raising to 2.6 when COLD over 2-3 days at which point it starts to leak internally. 1st engineer disconnected filling loop and there was a steady drip.  Now I'm no plumber but if water is leaking past the filling loop taps when the taps are closed then it's not doing it's job.  YET they DID NOT replace the loop/valves.  they've been 3 times now to fit Schrader valve, heat exchanger and some black plastic thing the engineer said could have gone BUT NOT the loop/valves.   Got them coming out for a 4th time as we now have a leak internally ALL the time (bucket underneath) coming from... *drumroll* ...the filling loop connection!  I'm actually happy as this just proves the mains pressure is getting past the valves, let's hope the next engineer just swaps them out.   I've had no issues getting a slot quickly so have to give 2 starts for that, if they had fixed the issue first time 5 but a bit annoyed that in 3 visits the obvious issue isn't being considered/resolved.  I'm just so glad I've got Homecare Cover as it would have cost a small fortune otherwise.

BRITISH GAS LIARS,SCAM AND RIP OFF

British Gas both supply and maintenance is a total rip off and they are scamming customers.
They state that they service and check your boiler with an annual service and they check that your central heating is in good working order.
This is totally untrue they don't check your central heating at all.
That makes it a scam because they falsely advertise it as part of the annual service.
Mine was supposedly checked and signed off by them however 3 valve leaks occurred in a very short time one the same leak twice causing considerable damage to a newly decorated kitchen.
They try to say they are not responsible, but the damage was caused by sheer incompetence of their lazy engineer who did not check the central heating system at all.
Their policy also states accidental damage is included.
I would like to know how they are checking a central heating system is in good working order without so much as turning it on and checking each radiator is hot and does not need bleeding.
This is false advertising by them and a scam to con people out of money.
Many people have stayed with them years because they think it is a hassle to change but it is very easy to change suppliers.
It‚Äôs actually very easy and can be done with a simple phone call to any other supplier.
British gas also is ripping people off on the cost of gas and electric.
Standing charges and unit charges are much cheaper with other suppliers there are now many.
Don‚Äôt think they treat loyal customers of many years any different because they do not
British gas is a rip off company who could not care less about their customers.
According to the press British gas are losing nearly 100000 customers a month as people wake up to better service and prices from other suppliers.

British Gas are totally useless and a waste of space .
My report now goes to the financial ombudsman .
My assessment of the situation is exactly what happened.
British Gas was given every opportunity to sort the situation out amicably and after dealing with them locally they failed to even respond to a complaint letter sent to head office.
The sheer arrogance of this company is unbelievable and don't be fooled by there false advertising.
My advice is keep clear of this scam company.
They also after 2 weeks still have not returned an overpayment of ¬£160 if next week l still don't receive it l will issue county court debt proceedings against them.
I terminated both my accounts with them and changed suppliers on 25th March.
2weeks ago they said I would receive a cheque in 3 -5days MORE LIES!
I spoke to these incompetent fools again today they have not even processed my refund they just told me it will be another 10 days.
The way this company now operates is totally beyond belief.
What a totally ridiculous reply from British gas had the incompedent engineer tested the system to be be in a safe working condition as per British Gas advertising he would have found the leak but as he failed to check the system was in a safe working condition he did not find it .As previously stated how is BG checking a Central heating system properly without even switching it on ?lt is a ludicrous reply which by the way is also supposedly covered for accidental damage so either way British Gas are responsible.The amount of bad reviews this lousy company has just goes to prove how bad they really are.
Update now I am preparing documents for the financial ombudsman.
British gas still remains a garbage company full of ....
lying to try to justify the incompetence of its useless staff .British gas Still lying trying to cover up for their incompetent lazy staff.
Their the in the news again by a well known magazine for wholesale ripping customers off again!!!I still want to know how they are checking the safe working condition of the central heating without switching it on.Maybe it's done by magic as they cannot answer the question. Without any foundation they tried to blame the decorator who did not even touch the rad valves having painted all the rads in situ ,just more lies from this lousy rip off company.
What a bunch of lying fools how can you check the safety and efficency without turning on the sysyem total clowns?No wonder so many people are leaving this muppet company.My decorator never touched the valves.
QUOTE""however the annual service is designed to check your boiler and system is working safely and in line with the relevant laws and regulations, not a complete check over your system to identify any potential faults. ""What a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! check without switching it on fools!!!!!!!! !

Disgusting company 
I was charged a ridiculous amount for my gas and electric (¬£800 for 3 months) which was obviously an error as we used our open fire and log burner. However, when I questioned this they never told me the correct amount dispite 6 months of chasing them, they just wanted me to pay the bill which they could not tell me the amount. An example of this is that we received 4 different 'estimates' in 1 week, and when we asked as to the correct one, they gave a different amount! And I received a different amount every time I enquired. Ended up sneakily putting 2 defaults on my credit file and when I discovered this 3 years later and questioned it, they would only offer ¬£20 as an 'apology' for their errors but Refuse to remove the 2 defaults (gas & electric) 
I will never use this vile company ever again! And suggest that everyone avoids it like the plague!

3. Once you switch to a supplier then you can reveal the fact that British gas is scammers and will charge you around ¬£1400/year!!

Avoid as spent over ¬£4,000 on a boiler, given the assurances of Homecare, then had three leaks, one on the day it was installed and two six months later and they have said as it was over six months since it was fitted it was not their problem even though their engineers came out three times to fix the leaks and to pursue it with our home insurance and they can put in a counterclaim with them.  Save your money and hassle and go with anyone else to save damage and repair costs to your property.  Absolutely appalling and shocking.

My 97 year old mum noticed water on her bathroom floor. A neighbour identified source of leak but could only stem it. Mum had Homecare through BG and from time of call an engineer was there in less than two hours. Excellent service- well done BG

First home, new customer.

This was by far the worst customer experience I have every received.
Tried three times to Get them out to update our electricity meter with they failed on all three accounts to show up which left me waiting for four house in a cold empty house middle of winter for them to never phone to imform me they weren‚Äôt coming.
One the forth attempts after waiting four hours thinking they‚Äôve failed me again, I walk out of the house and find their employee smoking on my drive way. Yes he gets the job done but he was not a friendly man.
When I got my smart meter installed, after a few months I noticed that hour payments had gone up drastically, this was only noticed became a payment of ¬£206 came out of our account suddenly. This surprised us because we had only been paying ¬£46 for two people.
When phoning we ask why we hadn‚Äôt been noticed by email or called to tell us above the rise in payments, we were meet by another bill of ¬£264 which we weren‚Äôt informed of. Customer service left us feeling confused, they couldn‚Äôt answer our questions on how and why we weren‚Äôt informed because apparently they think informaing customers means leaving a invoice for them on the British Gas website but never even emailing the customer to tell them it‚Äôs there.
Customer service was in one word unwelcoming, the first person I spoke to wasn‚Äôt intrested and soon hung up on me, the second one was just repeating themselves over and over and over again when I tried to ask them why we weren‚Äôt informed I asked if I could speak to another colleague, not manager colleague just to see if this was routine or their actual service, again no help, the third one practically argued with us and when we ask the leave them they hung up again for the second time they hung up. After we paid the bill which was very upsetting at this point we tried to get online assistance from their online chat room. Never again. Instead of helping us leave the company it just cancelled our direct debits. 
So after all of this we‚Äôve signed up with a new provider. But as a fair well message from British Gas our last bill wasn‚Äôt for a total of 17days billing us for ¬£100.59 and when I go to pay online they‚Äôve added an extra ¬£14.00 out of no where. There isn‚Äôt no point complaining to the company they never get back to you.

Please do not use British Gas.

Transferred to BG after collapse of Breeze Energy. BG much more expensive tarrif and have had continual problems trying to communicate with them. Arranged transfer out of BG and have just received hefty final statement which doesn't include credit balance Breeze made available to my BG account. Have tired to enquire about this but No Live Chat available, sent an email but got automated reply saying BG now only dealing with emergencies. Called BG phone number but automated message just refers you to their website - so going round in circles and comms not possible. I had to deal with BG a few years ago when we moved house; it was a nightmare then and it's still the same - expensive, poor comms, incorrect info and very poor customer service!

They came and changed my gas meter on 16 March 2020. Now I have no gas. When you need gas the most, I could not write down the words to explain how I feel. No one should read that amount of foul language.  Why cant there be zero stars or minus stars. One star is far too much.

Poor services, unprepared employees and poor customer service!

At the moment we are using the prepay solution for gas and wanted to change to smart meter. We were told that is possible, an engineer changed the meter, all good at first, then it stopped working. The new representative that came to fix the issue, did not seem interested in finding out what the problem is, he just changed back the meter to the old version. We then needed a new card to be sent in order to top up. He told us there is nothing we need to do, we will receive the card shortly. No card received, called them as we are running out of credit, so no hot water and heating for us, after hearing their complaints about how busy they are!!! they finally realized no one actually sent the card because the guy that changed the meter forgot to include the meter in their database...still trying to sort this out...

Maybe they would be less busy if they did a good job from the start not rework 3 times...

All I want is to speak with someone to solve a simple problem. It is not covered under FAQ, it can not be resolved online. You put your issue into webchat only to be told there is nobody there and to use the Contact Us page which doesn't exist. On bill payments it puts a telephone number which is unobtainable. One number says they are now closed without giving opening times. The telephone number on this site is also unavailable. Unless your house is about to go bang they make it very to solve a problem. You are better off going to another company

Agreed a DD for the length of my contract ¬£81) and after a couple of months they put it up to ¬£117, without telling me. I always pay my bills on time and energy contracts are always balanced at the end of each year, but at BG they want to take more and perhaps give a rebate at the end of the year, thus having used my money all year. Using the app and on their website, they don't even have my contract length correct. Contacting 'Customer Support' is virtually impossible. Any communication is always one-way. Live Chats are slow and useless. Get the email address and responses are little or none - Totally useless! Calling them is a forlorn hope

I have been in my property for 8 weeks with an electricity bill on ¬£485.00. I‚Äôm not even fully living in the property and have no odd appliances that eat energy.  Excessive !!also there is definitely a problem somewhere !! British Gas  have asked for a meter reading track for 7 days and my account manager from complaints dept was due to call me ...... no call
I then called customer service and speak to an agent called Rix . No empathy , complete lack of knowledge regarding the complaint but full of non helpful opinions and very negative and a little sarcastic The only offer was to go on a comparison site and find another provider!!
Still no call from customer complaints. 
So after 25 years with British has changed provider. 
It‚Äôs such a shame as I have been very loyal to the company but obviously that doesn‚Äôt work both ways . 
I would like to say however that Craig in customer complaints was more helpful and understanding. More staff of that quality British Gas!!

Absolutely dreadful customer ""service"". Once waited in all day for engineer no show. When I finally got thru next day they said that I had phoned to cancel!! I asked for the recording and asked why would i take a whole day off work and then cancel it! Annual fee rises every year boiler service due last Nov but earliest slot was Feb. Recd conf email that engineer was coming (night before) guess what? Never showed up. Phoned them (15 mins on hold) re-booked me for following week, took ANOTHER day off work - yep! never showed up. Was furious this time told no engineers available and diff dept sends out the conf emails. Finally go service (the engineer was brilliant) then decided to cancel my agreement (u don't need to give notice) did this over phone a week ago& cancelled my DD. They promised me conf letter, called them today - it had not been generated system error. Another person said I wld rec conf email but another said it's letter only! they just can't get their act together and they DO NOT CARE about the customer. Avoid at all costs!

We had no heat order hot water.  Despite having a service contract, the earliest appointment was over 3 weeks away.  That is no fun in February.

My complaint is like many on here, seems they refuse to listen and learn from their mistakes, or simply don‚Äôt care about their customers.  We‚Äôve been with British Gas for 8 years, paying monthly by direct debit for home care. Part of this is for an annual check on our gas boiler. Only once in the 8 years has the appointment that was made for an engineers to come out honoured on time. Every time after they just fail to turn up on the appointment day, and when you eventually manage to talk to someone they say, due to sickness bla bla bla, once they said they knocked and no-one was home, so when I mentioned my CCTV and no one had called, they eventually said, oh he off sick. Last year 2019, our gas boiler wasn‚Äôt serviced at all, to many failed appointments and I frankly gave up on them. Now were moving home soon, so I called to make an appointment for the gas boiler to be serviced, 3 months was the wait time, so I complained and said we would have moved by then, so I managed to get the appointment for mid-March. If I‚Äôm honest I just know they will cancel or just not turn up. I‚Äôve cancelled my account with them. Truly shocking company, only thing we can do it switch and leave, they don‚Äôt seem to care about their reputation or customer care, so hit them where it hurts, they cash flow.

Brtish Gas are the worse. My home care cover includes 1 kitchen appliance. It been an absolute nightmare trying to get my dish washer fixed. This has been ongoing for  the past year. The issue I have is getting an engineer to actually  come out. Often, and despite arranging a visit,no engineer turns up on the day, or they pretend that an engineer came to the house and knocked on the door.  Even though I have been in the house waiting all day for the engineer to arrive. This situation occurred a few times. Or an engineer will turn up only to say that the pre ordered parts haven't arrived or that they  have arrived only to be sent back to the supplier ( for no reason). So it continues.

The service Dyno Rod has provided is deficient as it failed on several occasions to diagnose a leak in my home over several months. Dyno Rod, reassured me that there was not a leak on numerous occasions despite my insistence and that of Essex water that their was a leak was in the house causing higher than average bills.

I then incurred massive damage to my property from and had to contact my home insurance to remove contents and repair.

The complaints liaison that British Gas/DynoRod provided was ineffective and took several months to investigate my complaint and on one occasion apologised for the delay because he was ill.

Their insurance is denying liability and his resolution was for my insurance contacting theirs to sort out and an offer of ¬£200 which I refused. I intend to make their actions public and look at obtaining a fair resolution legally. 

I have reported to the Ombudsman and taken advice from Which? Legal as I have had Looses of over ¬£2000 which are:
Insurance Excess - over ¬£600
Increase in insurance premiums
Inability to use rooms and living room to date 
Inconvenience and time taken off work to deal with the results of the damage. 

Please be aware that DynoRod/British Gas‚Äôs home emergency cover is quite happy to take premiums but their service is extremely poor and they do not accept responsibility when their failure to rectify a small problem causes massive amounts of damage.

Rubbish customer service . We pay too much money .
We have two meters at home and we call British Gas to explain them that something must be wrong because it is not really possible to pay the same tariff for both of the meters .  We were on the phone for 2 hours trying to explain the situation and no one of the staff was able to help us I personally think that they don't really know the job.  Finally we have been told that the management will look at our account and try to sort the things out for us .  Unfortunately they haven't contact us at all and they just take the money of  form the direct debit . Seems to me that no one from their management staff even looked at our account .  The reality is actually that you can't really explain your problem they just don't  know what to do  . So disappointed that we have switch to British Gas .

British Gas have a serious issue with honesty and transparency IM experience! Currently compiling case for the Ombudsman as I felt that I had no alternative but to leave with ongoing complaints unresolved and more and more irregular activity on my online account. Still a customer and no accounts settled but my meter read history has been archived and some non-bill meter reads pertinent to my complaint I am told have been removed! This is not the open honest solutions orientated approach one would wish for. The issues is a systems issue they should be grateful that I am highlighting it. System records meter reads as customer generated meter reads when they are not. Not good British Gas though I do see that others are suffering much worse. I CANNOT RECOMMEND this company but I do acknowledge that there are some hard working operatives who do their best to help, beleaguered customers when being thwarted by the companies systems and customer relations acting against customer interest rather than helping.

We have been trying recently to get a reasonable date for an inspection of our boiler and central heating, and we have a Homecare agreement with the company until the 20th March this year. The best date they can currently give is early April.
 ( now early February)
 The British Gas contract with us with us will have then expired and therefore they could be considered to be in breach of contract with us. We took our Homecare agreement  again after many years with them in 2019,  which includes an inspection in the annual period.
 How do expect expect long term customers to continue with them, when the company operate with limited demolished staff,cannot meet agreements, and this year by normal standards has been a mild one in the South. Any help from British Gas would be extremely helpful. It suggests that the directors of the company and management are very distant from the actual service service they can provide.

Home Care is an absolute rip off. We paid the fees and had nothing for nearly 2 years. Then when boiler was playing up took a month to get an appointment. Then they said you need a power flush but refused to give an appointment. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll contact you when we have availability‚Äô they said - literally. Home Care package is a SCAM. Avoid.

20th of January I ordered a hive outdoor camera to be installed for the 3rd February.

3rd February - No engineer turns up and I end up speaking to 8 different people until a new installation date is booked in for the 5th 

5th February - Engineer turns up to install HIVE heating !? I quote ""I can't install cameras mate"" engineer informs me to wait twenty minutes for the electrician to turn up. 2 Hours later no electrician !? Another 2 hours on the phone to British gas and Hive to be told sorry we booked the wrong job we can get an electrician to you tomorrow

6th February - Electrician turns up, I quote "" wheres the camera ?"" We were informed that the camera would be delivered with the electrician when they came to fit it. According to the engineer they never carry cameras with them. 

So after the third failed attempt and my patience hanging on by a thread, I phone to cancel and get a refund. Another hour of being passed from one department to another to be told only the payment team can give you a refund. Can I speak to them then ? The answer a simple no even were not allowed to speak to them.

I've never being so disappointed or disgusted at the level of service provided by such a supposedly customer focused company

Shambolic! New boiler installation booked with definite dates - spent two days holiday off work and no engineers and no joy with phone calls - eventually started three days later causing real stress as had to return to work. My home was treated appallingly,  and with little to no respect.  Oil type black marks everywhere and bannisters are going to need redecorating as now permeated the paintwork. BG engineers left dirt and incorrectly fitted pipework causing overheating. Had to get local engineer as BG would not sent anyone back for five days. Electrics wrong place, mucky carpets which I had to shampoo. Taken three months for them to totally complete job which should have been finished by 30th October. Claims department very insulting and totally ignorant (wilfully, I would say), in an effort to avoid paying any sensible damages etc. One of the most expensive experiences of my life.  They just don't get it!  Never recommend them.  I could write a very good article in the national press on my experiences here!

Appliance Cover - The service is atrocious (and that makes them sound too good). December call out (now February), So far no repair. 3 cancelled appointment and 2 engineers, one of whom was not allowed to look at repair as he was only authorised on certain brands! Absolutely outrageous. In no way can I recommend British Gas Homecare. In fact put the money in a savings account and call a local tradesman is something happens. Unfit for purpose!

I have had British Gas Home Care for over 20 years, the service used to be excellent. However over the last year or so it has deteriorated enormously. I tried to get an engineer to repair my dishwasher and was told that I will have to wait for just over two weeks. The engineer was due for tomorrow, Thursday 6 February but I have just received a phone call saying that there is no engineer available and that I will have to wait until next Tuesday, that is another 4 days. A broken dishwasher is not a major issue but when you pay over ¬£600 for home care services then you have the right to expect a prompt response and you should not be made to rearrange your daily activities around the availability of a British Gas Engineer. I am just pondering whether to renew my Home Care Insurance.

Joke of a company. I took a 3 Appliance Insurance Policy out for what seemed a reasonable ¬£13 a month.
Their system decided to auto-combine it with my Boiler policy which was due to expire in 3 weeks. They then `renewed` the Policy after 3 weeks, increased the cost by 30% and helped themselves to the whole 12 month payment of ¬£217 in one go without any indications of why. I couldn't ever get through to speak to anyone, even their Chat window was useless, I was passed through 6 people and got nowhere. Finally spoke to someone after 5 days of trying who just kept saying `I had chosen to add` the appliances to my cover. Useless and couldn't care less! Typical big company mentality.

There are many cheaper energy providers out there but sometimes you don‚Äôt mind paying more if you get a good service. My mums been with British Gas for a while now. Just before Christmas they decided to deduct a few hundred from her account without telling her. I called them and they said it‚Äôs because for a year they had been undercharging (my mums got a smart meter). I then realised for that whole period they had never sent her a bill, which they admitted to. She also owed even more money, that was just a part payment. I know maybe she should have realised that but when someone from British Gas estimated what her monthly usage would be who would think we could go over that by so much. I explained to British gas that my mum had been caring for me, her young daughter through breast cancer, along with caring for my granddad (her dad) who had passed away and caring for my nan (her mum). This meant that my mum was unable to work so money was tight, especially with me having to live at home again. I thought that as I was dealing with British Gas we might have been dealt with a little more efficiently. I raised this on 29th of November and no matter how many times I call or emails I send they just keep saying it‚Äôs still being looked into. My mum has never in her life had a debt or owed money so this is really stressful for her. 
If anyone is looking on here to decide whether to go with British Gas, I wouldn‚Äôt bother. It will be fine until you have a problem and then you will never hear back from them.

I first moved into my flat 10 years ago and soon after was issued with a gas bill for almost ¬£500, even though the flats were newly built! I don‚Äôt like gas and my son fitted my ELECTRIC oven into my kitchen..After 2011 approximately I started to receive gas bills quarterly and rang numerous times explaining that I neither had a metre nor used gas..In approximately 2014 I received a bill for ¬£450... I rang again and again getting told that I had a metre in my flat ( I didn‚Äôt) and that this was for a standing charge..Eventually I found out that they had installed a metre in a chamber not even near my block! On finding this out I asked for it to be removed immediately but waited ages (My elder sister at this time was terminally ill and I was helping with her care) until finally an engineer was sent to remove it. The metre read 000000 usage! Recently I received yet another bill for ¬£249.20 threatening a default notice ( I was issued with a CCJ for the last bill) so now I‚Äôm ill and still I‚Äôm getting nowhere with them!

Continually cancelled service appointments on our boiler / fire, despite taking huge monthly d.debit payments.
They are a business who have to observe the laws of the land like any other, yet arrogantly feel they are untouchable.
They quoted page 28 of their terms and conditions (which they have never supplied), thus: no refunds.
Any other business operation with such ""sharp"" practice would be sweating on a court appearance.

Had a new boiler installed by BG in Sept '18 and was rather happy with the installation and engineer attitudes, and gave them a very good review against scores of poor reviews.
A year later I received an email that unless I had the boiler serviced, their 5-year warranty would be nulled. I was impressed with their reminder. I called to book, and was given an appointment 9-10 weeks into the future (!!!), that they were so fully booked.
Come the day, I take time off, and no one turns up and no reasons nor apology received. When I approached them to enquire a few days later, I was told yes there had been a booking for me but they had a technical issue (!!), and the engineer did not turn up. At least they acknowledged that there had been a booking, for this I give them 2 stars. 
Again they offered me a new appointment 9-10 weeks into the future. I asked if they could not kindly prioritise mine as they had messed me up. I was told I had to take what was available.
This 'take it or leave it (or your warranty will be nulled) is the attitude they have to get out of. They should heed the scores of negative feed back that they receive.

Appalling customer service from a once top of the league company but alas no more. As a customer for 35yrs the company have gone downhill massively and i had a shocking experience on the telephone like one of the other reviewers. I also saw on my online account they was planning on increasing my electricity direct debit by a further ¬£100 a month and i had to ring to tell them it had been calculated wrong as there was payments not credited to my account which they had not allowed for. It was a uk customer services issue but i was put on hold for quite a while why the adviser so called reckoned up my consumption , only to be transfered to a collection team without my knowledge then harrased by a toe rag who thought i was an easy target because im widowed and he  made me feel like a criminal. We ended up arguing and i put the phone down on him with nothing resolved and i was very upset and shaken at the ruthlessness of this arrogent man. I can imagine an elderly person would be scared and distraught and feel bullied with staff who stoop so low. Cocky in my opinion. Anyway i promptly made a complaint about him and the previous adviser who put me through probably because she couldnt handle the enquiry. I am now awaiting the outcome of the complaint but Im afraid theyve lost my custom as a result of this telephone call experience. They used to have a customer services team they could be proud of who was polite and helpful but most of all staff who could do their jobs, was motivated and helped the customer and resolved any issues. Now they resort to bully boy tactics and imposing fear on vulnerable customers. This is a big step back from british gas. No wonder customers are leaving in their thousands. Money will spend anywere and loyalty means nothing to them anymore.

I have phoned up on several occasions and asked for an update on my complaint to be told that someone will call me back. this never happened and lead to them entering my property with a warrant (due to dispute) and changing my meter.

Smart meter app is shockingly bad. So slow and out of date. Never says the correct balance. First top up ¬£10 which has been taken from my bank on my bank statements which never arrived on smart meter no email from BG no receipt number from BG. Still trying to contact BG recorder telephone message says sorry calls can take 45 minutes to answer please call back in 48 hours and then cuts you off. We was emergency credit as meter had only just been installed. So we tried agin this time only ¬£5 which took one hour to register on the meter. We thought at last let‚Äôs try ¬£50 but apparently BG app said we had reached our limit for the day. So we then had to wait until midnight to try again which at last it worked. I thought great ¬£55 on gas smart meter. App still says we have a total of ¬£3.88 which was updated at 12.00 am on the 9th Jan it is now 23.55 pm  on 10th Jan almost 36 hours later and it still says we only have ¬£3.88.

Awful awful experience with British Gas. Chose to go with them when I moved into a new house. Had issues getting my meter working, signed up for direct debit but they never came and swapped the meter. Took the direct debit but didn't supply what I had paid for. At one point an agent straight up lied and told me that my money had been taken for an installation fee. Then the new boiler was installed, but not signed off properly or guaranteed. Booked in for a smart meter and on the day, the engineer informed me he wasn't coming as he was emergencies only. I've had to take days and days off work and nothing has been sorted. On my 5th official complaint and had to get a third party involved as they never bothered to respond.No one takes responsibility. You get transferred from department to department and nothing has been resolved. When I spoke to the complaints team, they informed me that 'different customers value their own time differently' - and they clearly don't value it at all. I am so angry and frustrated and just miserable from the whole thing. I wish someone had warned me just how awful they would be and how disappointing there service would be.

Shocking service after 13 years loyalty and ¬£1000's of pounds.
We've had them since 2007, we are supposed to have an ANNUAL (that means once per year) boiler service as part of a CONTRACT.
I put my house up for sale in September, called in October to see when my boiler service was due. I was told it was serviced the previous October. As it's an ANNUAL service, it was due. I called to be told there's a three month waiting list and it couldn't be done until January.
I explained that it would be overdue, they then started quoting small print etc and said ""technically"" as the contract had originally been taken out in January 2007 it wasn't classed as overdue until January!
However they knew they had a three month backlog, every year they email a reminder that the service is due, they've failed to do it this time. They should have emailed in July ready for a three month future appointment in October.
They aren't bothered in the least, they are still advertising for new customers to join the Homecare agreement bit can't cope with the ones they've got! They also fitted two replacement smoke alarms as part of the gas, drains and electrical insurance agreement. A year later they both went faulty and wouldn't stop bleeping. I had a baby trying to sleep overnight, the nearest engineer was 150 miles away with an ETA of four hours minimum.
We had two options, not sleep or disconnect the smoke alarms. They later denied fitting that make and model at all until I pulled paperwork to prove they had supplied them. The engineer who replaced the faulty ones (three days we were without a smoke alarm!) told me 
that British gas were aware that the ones he was replacing were a faulty design, but they'd previously denied it.
So we pay ¬£600 a year for people to service the boiler annually and they don't. They fitted faulty smoke alarms, denied they fitted them then we're forced to admit they do.
Finally after arguing on Twitter with them, as they wouldn't answer the phone, they published my personal and private phone number to the entire world via their Twitter page and it was up for over an hour!!!.
They were good originally, they're now taking on too much work, can't cope and don't care.
To sell my house, despite them getting ¬£600 a year, I've been forced to pay for an independent gas engineer to service my boiler so the buyer will sign for my house!
Just look at the Twitter feed for them, they're not servicing 100's of people's boilers annually at all.

I am a customer of breeze energy who has apparently been switched to British gas. As I do not want to be a British gas customer I followed the instructions in their email to contact them to cancel this contract. However when I finally got through to an agent he refused to let me cancel this contract. So I have NEVER agreed to become a customer of British gas and they are refusing to let me cancel a contract I never requested. This is preventing my switch to octopus and just causing me wasted time completing complaints. Unbelievably bad customer service - but then that is what they are best known for.

I'm so disgusted with British Gas. I pay for Homecare services at ¬£42.71 monthly. Everytime I book for someone to come out for a problem no one turns up. I have been flood with excuses after excuses. So far for my current problem they have missed 4 appointments. Left me sitting at home waiting for the Engineer to turn up, no one turns up and no one calls. Here are some of the rediculous excuses I have been told. 

The Engineer came and said I have a metal bell? I don't have a metal bell...

The Engineer called? I did not get any call....

Why did not the Engineer leave a message if they called? Their not allowed to leave messages.

These Engineers refuse to go to jobs and make up any excuse to cover their backs. I have emailed in complaint after complaint and have received no response. My last appointment was stared, meaning their not to miss this appointment. They still did not turn up. All they did was cancel the job and start again so it does not show up as 3 missed appointments. First and second appointment was rescheduled automatically. Third appointment was stared meaning not to be missed. After this the whole job was cancelled. So I'm starting back with appointment one. That's how they cover themselves.

British Gas usually pays out ¬£30 per missed appointment. For all 4 appointments missed they offered me an insulting ¬£40. British Gas have previously paid out 1.1 million in 2017 for missed appointments. Google it. 

There is no point me paying for Homecare services and not receiving the service I'm paying for. I'm leaving now. Good bye British Gas. I'm talking my custom elsewhere and also I found homecare services cheaper elsewhere. Over the past 5 years they have missed approximately 25 appointments with me. I have lost all hope in the company. 

Rediculous....

No paypoint so use payzone. My town does not have not payzone only paypoint still. Nearest payzone is by using car how inconvenient if you don't drive, but guess what I have been told today. Sorry, we don't have payzone or it's not working. British gas best be ready for me tomorrow for causing such inconvenience towards me for not being able to top up this evening. What a mess and a disaster all this is. If I could vote zero star then I would so pretend that I have. I begrudge giving one star. Plus they need to update there website as the 0800 numbers do not exist anymore.

MOST INCOMPETENT COMPANY i am now on day 12 on trying to sort out problems on top of problems with them. I moved to new home and signed up with them 18th Dec and then I received a bill  days later for NOVEMBER??? How is that possible if i never signed up into end of Dec. They sent 2 idiots round to sort my gas and electricity as no power in the house. I waited from 7am to 6.20pm when they finally arrived. They changed the smart meter which had credit on to a key machine. Said they had topped it up the machine for me and if.i needed.more.credit.call.them back ??? I should of known from that sentence they were being tossers. Turns out them 2 idiots put me on emergency. Which i didnt realise until it had ran out  when the gas safety company came to restore heating. They were not prepared to wait while we ran out to top up so now we have to wait for another appointment. I called for my refund and a rude THAPELO MLILO hung up on me i called again a nice lady tried to connect me but i was cut off so when called a 3rd time i was told after 30min in hold that there is something wrong with my meter
I said he was mistaken as i topped today he put me back on hold and came with he will top my meter
 Erm no thank you send a cheque thats when he got snotty and replied well it will take 21 days bye

My boiler went crazy late on a Saturday morning four days before Christmas.I managed to get a slot the same day. Within two hours I had an engineer sorting it out. He was lovely, polite, cheerful and calm! Within 45 minutes he had fixed the issue and phoned two days later to check the boiler was ok. He even thanked me for being a nice customer.

british gas homecare customers be warned BG is seriously selling their new boilers
first time engineer repairs boiler second time he says it cant be repaired you need a new boiler which they are happy to install for you at a disconnect and look for finance for you but if you have poor credit rating you are doomed not boiler and not repair and you are left in the cooled.
I cant get a loan because someone stole my identity and still police with case and therefore no boiler after paying homecare cover for years and calling them twice and engineer says its unrepairable but problems started after he visited the property because water started leaking which was never there before.He denied he ever did anything but we all knew he did.

I have the Homecare Two Boiler and Central Heating cover. My advice to anyone thinking of taking out this cover think carefully. I have waited in for 3 consecutive engineer visits and not any of them showed. Not even a curtious phone call from the engineer to say they will be late or need to re-schedule. Contacted the customer services an hour before the time slot was due to expire today and they said they couldn't contact the engineer but the job sheet said ""call customer to let them know eta of visit"" There poor service has resulted in me having to take time off work and lose some holiday, just in case they turn up.

Customer service is a disgrace. They changed their terms and conditions by no longer sending reminders of gas appliance serving. No notification was sent about this change.

Terrible service
I have had boiler and central heating cover/Homecare cover with British Gas for years and have hardly ever claimed. When the cold weather arrived one radiator wasn't working so I booked online for an engineer visit. This was 3 weeks ago, with the visit due tomorrow. Just had a phone call from BG to say they can't come tomorrow because they are too busy and need to rebook for 3rd January! Apart from having had to make arrangements to make sure someone is in tomorrow, I have my grandchildren coming down next week and will be in an unheated room. I told BG I will get someone in and send them the bill but they seemed to think their terms excluded this. I think they need a lesson in contract law! Terrible so-called service and I will now, after many years, be looking for another provider and claiming a refund for this year's premium.

I pay for a homecare contract and have done for several years, we were due to have our boiler serviced on the 7th October, waited in all day only to get cancelled at 3:30pm that afternoon because the engineer was running late, rearranged for the 10th December only to get a call once again to cancel us yet  again, this time its because they have too many breakdowns. Our latest date is January 27th 2020 I won't hold my breath. I pay for an annual service not a biannual service. The reason you have too many breakdowns is because you never seem to do any sevices.

As a small business owner I had an horrendous experience with billing and their customer complaints department. To cut a long story very short, they charged extortionate out of contract fees initially, refused to give me a DD discount, even though I paid by DD, they did not collect on a set up DD for 4 months, then chased for the full amount, even though I had an agreed payment plan in place and, to cap it all, I was told by an incredibly impatient man by the name of Stefan Adamek that I could obviously afford to pay up to date (!) and should do so immediately. The same chap hid behind a 'final decision', peppered with blatant untruths. A horrible time and I can't wait to leave. Their prices are good, though you can get better. In terms of customer service I have never had, in 5 decades, a worse experience. Naturally I am unable to recommend

Just finished a phone call with a very nice British Gas Homecare Salesman - Douglas - who very patiently took my rather rude telephone call to him regarding my Homecare contract and then proceeded to solve my issues one by one and reduce my monthly payments but still managing to give me what I wanted in my Homecare contract. Very professional and efficient as well as being a very nice man, answering every question that I fired at him with patience and a resolution.

If I could give no stars I would. 

I signed up as they are a well-known name and you would think that they supply the service and I pay for it. 

At no point did I get the smart meter installed despite calling a number of times. 

To get through to them takes the best part of an hour every time. 

They cancelled my account at one point and when I called they said it was their error.

They then refunded me ¬£750 as they said I had overpaid, I spent this on a holiday for my wife and I and then they said that was an error and wanted the money back. 

I complained to the Ombudsman who made them give me a heavy discount but before I could pay for it, they gave it to debt collectors.

I have since moved to SSE and they are better and far cheaper.  

Avoid British Gas at all costs, they are truly terrible.

Disgusting company. I pay dual fuel by DD and they wildly  vary the amount to be paid following review. This has been between ¬£40, ¬£110, ¬£90 ¬£70 and recently increased this to ¬£115. Following the last agreed plan they took almost ¬£200 from my account.

I rang to complain. They admitted it was a mistake but were unable to help. Dealing with them is like talking to a crossword puzzle. Three times I rang them to be asked to speak to Customer complaints, and they hung up every time.
I have now submitted a formal complaint by e-mail and asked to be contacted as a degree of urgency as they literally have money belonging to me that I can ill afford. To jump from ¬£70 one month to ¬£200 the next when they actually agreed ¬£115 then deny the opportunity to rectify this is unwarranted and a disgrace.

I refuse to pay good money to be treated like mess on a shoe by incompetent call handlers.

I am going to cancel my DD and vote with my feet. I can see this complaint going all the way to the ombudsman.

British Gas homecare is a massive con. I had a leak from an upstairs bathroom coming through the ceiling of the pantry. Not a flood, just staining on the ceiling. The very young guy who came easily found the problem after cutting out a square of the ceiling, turned off the heating , drained a rad and fixed the connection that was leaking. Then he couldn‚Äôt get the heating working again. He left and said a colleague would come to put the heating back on as that wasn‚Äôt his area of expertise. The colleague duly arrived and reset THE BOILER and said it would all be fine. FIVE DAYS later I still have no hot water or heating and the next appointment I am being offered is in 3 days time. If that works it will be 8 DAYS TO FIX A PROBLEM CAUSED BY BRITISH GAS. This is not a service it is a PONZI scam robbing home owners.

After waiting 3 weeks for an engineer appointment. He came & all he wanted to do was quote me for a power flush as 3 out of 10 radiators were heating up very slowly. I told him of a leak on the filling loop & he said that he didn't want to repair it as it would let air in the system & was only causing a problem when I add water to the system. So I will not be renewing my ¬£23 per month contract. Will now have to pay an independent engineer who says they can most likely sort the problem by flushing out the individual radiators. Have been with British Gas service for 10 years & they used to be good but have noticed that the engineers & mostly now young guys trained up to sell you all they can. Goodbye British Gas in January.

Had British Gas out this morning to look at my boiler that was not igniting. The engineer was very nice and helpful. He managed to temporary fix the boiler until the part arrives next week. Very pleased with the service provided.

Booked annual service in September to take place in November, appointment was cancelled by BG the day before it was due and moved to the end of January.

They have scammed me, they said we were in credit ¬£200 then the next day they said we owe them ¬£200. Bearing in mind me have not had our heating on for the last 10 months. Stay away. They set up us with a plan to pay their exstorunate bill monthly and then said they will have bailiffs at our door. Please stay clear. The staff are extremely rude and are just after your money. They are by fair the most expensive company out their. Please stay away. The only reason I gave them 1 star is because I didn‚Äôt have a choice for no stars. Their bills unreadable and make no sense.

I have had British Gas homecare for over 5 years. They used to be excellent fixing problems quickly. However, I have just been left with no heating for 17 days as i am not deemed a priority case. The engineers when they do arrive are really good but you have to wait weeks for an appointment. Although the customer advisors are polite and do thier best they are not able to do anything as the demand is too high. Do not take homecare out, especially if you are vunerable British Gas cannot keep up with demand and it is not worth the money.

We have found Homecare engineers have all been friendly and professional and employed by BG, but the phone system and admin is appallingly bad. I've just hung up after waiting in the phone queue for over an hour. Their system gives you no indication of where you are in the queue or how long your wait will be. We've had incorrect charges, disputes over what is covered by the Homecare contract (which we eventually won) and DynoRod engineers turning up on the wrong date or with incorrect experience or partsto do simple fixes.

weve been a bg Homecare customer for several rentals for many years.  however the last two callouts have taken 7 days!  this is far too long... obviously.  although Stuart Cave (our so called multi premise account manager!) thinks this is reasonable!!!!!!!!
we asked him to confirm that in writing but he hasnt.  just to add insult to injury after waiting six days for the appointment, no one turned up!!!!!!!!  this was last thursday (14/11/19).  apparently they didnt despatch our callout as they had a priority!!!!  instead they wanted to postpone the callout for another six days (i.e. until 20/11/19) when no doubt it would be cancelled again by another higher priority jumping the queue.
This really is outrageous service and a breach of the contract which states callouts will be in a reasonable time.  12 or even 6 days is not reasonable.  apparently the delay is due to unexpected circumstances (WINTER!!!!!!!!!).
BG used to come same or next day which was fine.  we will most likely not renew with bg again as we have had huge grief from our tenants (understandably) and had to compensate them.  This defeats the whole objective of boiler cover which is to avoid such stressful problems and maintain good relations with tenants.
I see that 'HOMETREE' have better reviews and will give them a try.  seems BG dont give a s!@?.
BTW as our tenant is having an operation next week we were made a priority (for all they know the op. was for an ingrowing toe nail... that just encourages people to lie to get a quicker appointment) and got a callout 15/11/19.  but the new part wasnt fitted until 18/11/19.  the engineer was professional and competent, BUT DEFINITELY CANT SAY SAME FOR REST OF BG.
we have made formal complaint but no proper response, only acknowledgement.

I called BG to switch to direct debit when I moved to my new home. They sent an email confirming it is switch and that on every 15th money will be taken out. On 12th, they cut our power, an engineer was sent after calling them, the engineer said that it is still pay as you go and you should top up, they haven't changed it. I call BG again, after an hour of wait on the line, they say that it is credit not pay as you go and they cannot do anything, after 30 minutes of them putting me on hold and waiting, they give me a smart card number to top up, which turns out that it doesn't work. So we end up spending the night without power as they close at 8pm. as I work online, this caused me lose ¬£502 pounds due to unplanned cancellation on my side from the company I work in, so cost me part of my salary. when I called BG, someone called Kyle completely refused taking any responsibility and kept repeating that it was my responsibility to top up, even though I couldn't and they had it on the system that it is credit, and took these incompetent workers more than a day to connect my power. It turns out I still cannot top up until 15th, so after many multiple calls and talking to so many stupid workers in there who don't even know what they're doing, finally someone changes the system to pay as you go. And guess what, I get charged ¬£15 for direct debit, which I didn't use.

So this stupid company makes a big mess up, thinking my account is direct debit, cuts my power cause apparently its pay as you go and you need to top up, even after calling, they can't top me up and give me wrong code. this causes loss of income of ¬£502, they don't take any responsibility, when I file a claim, they keep writing wrong information down in their system and end up charging me ¬£15. How is this legal and how is this company still running, it needs to be shut down.

I have had homecare cover for a few years, and it has generally been very good. This year the service seems to have fallen off a cliff. The wait for an appointment is much longer, and there is no guarantee that someone will turn up for the appointment. The website frequently has problems.

I had my fuse board updated by British Gas in August 2019 ref:1412011519, since the 25 October I have been complaining about a problem I am having but is simply being ignored. I have had 5 emails and one letter stating they are investigating and will get in touch. The time scale was between 72 hours to 8 weeks, no one have contacted me since. I emailed the CEO Sarwjit Sambhi, but I am not holding my breath for a response. Out of desperation I contacted the engineer who did the work, he did not want to know until I said that I was concerned there may be a fire. He arrange for an engineer to come round.
This man turned up stating he was sent to give me a quote for electrical work I wanted carried out on the property, nothing to do with my complaint they just wanted to get more money out of me.

Don't bother with a homecare agreement, cheaper and significantly quicker if you just find a local gas engineer.

The actual BG engineers have always been great when they've turned up for a service or a repair, however I've just had tomorrow's annual service pushed back until mid January and hearing lots of stories of people going 10 days + without heating and hot water whilst waiting for an ""emergency"" call out.  The company is unable to properly plan the use of its resources and it's not fair to expect customers to pay hundreds of pounds for cover that offers completely inadequate service levels.

Customer service staff really couldn't care less either, the person I spoke to was eating whilst on the call and didn't even try to offer any sort of apology.

Bought a flat which was registered to British Gas already (the previous owner forgot to close their account). That was fixed without issue. I gave the details of the flat since I don't have access to meter and was told my bill would be ¬£40/month.
6 months later, after a review, I was around ¬£120 in credit (i.e. I'd been overpaying based on my usage). Bill didn't change though.
Another 6 months later, I get a letter saying my bill was going up to ¬£93/month and that I was ¬£100+ pounds in debit. Confused, I called BG to ask what was going on - they genuinely couldn't tell me, their system apparently doesn't give any details. But they said they could bring my bill down to ¬£67/month. For context: I live in a small 1 bed flat. A single radiator in the living room is enough to heat the place and only goes on when a jumper isn't enough to get warm. There's not a chance in hell I'm using ¬£67 worth of electricity every month, never mind ¬£93.
Told them that's a joke and I got on Uswitch and changed supplier immediately.

I signed up
To smart pay as you go after many years being on this type of prepayment and it worked well for me. No bills or debt which I really liked.
After the change over date I was placed into credit mode until smart meters installed this was ok for and I would money aside for the final credit bill after meters installed. Meters were installed well over a month after change over and I expected and signed up for smart pay as u go.
smart meters installed were not pre payment method Meyer‚Äôs and after a few weeks of trying to get what I signed up for in a contract was told oh no we can‚Äôt change you to what you did infact believe you was getting because we don‚Äôt do that Ian your area.
I am now on a credit smart deal that was not requested or indeed promised.
I was totally missold this utility and left with a service I did ask for want or even agree to.
I was lied to over the phone, promised call backs that I never received and still now over two months later in the dark over what can be done.
I have since cancelled all my home insurance boiler etc after years of being a loyal customer and await a resolution for gas electric supply but their ignorance of this case will probably mean I need to switch suppliers again.

I suggest that anyone taking out a Home Care agreement be aware of this as when you pay insurance you do not expect to be charged more in excess for any claim than the repair actually cost!
We have been Home Care customers for a few years. Recently we had need to call them out as we awoke to a large water stain on our living room ceiling and wall. This was directly below the bathroom so I went to investigate. When I moved a storage cupboard we have in the on of the tiles fell off revealing damp and mouldy plasterboard. This was on the boxing around the pipework for the toilet. It was that damp that you could easily put your finger through it. As I could not see the pipework as it went into the wall I called British Gas Home Care.
I will be fair to them, they did give an appointment that day. The engineer came, looked at the toilet and found a bolt needed tightening on the freshwater inlet as it had a slight leak. This took him 2 minutes. I asked about the pipework in the wall and showed him the damp and mouldy plasterboard, also explaining about the patch downstairs. He advised that all internal pipework would be fine as it would be plastic. He told me to wait a few week for the plaster to dry and then stick the tile back on. I asked again if he should check it and he advised that there was no need to.
He was in the house for 3-4 minutes as the most and all he did was tighten a bolt.
Today I have received an invoice for ¬£60 excess, now I accept that I have an excess of ¬£60 on the plan but I doubt the job cost ¬£60 so I rang British Gas to query this amount. I am not trying to get away with paying it and I fully expect that if the job cost ¬£60.01 I would pay the first ¬£60 of this. What I also expected was that if the job was less than ¬£60 I would only pay the actual amount of the job. For example if the job cost ¬£40 I would pay ¬£40. This is not the case I still have to pay the full ¬£60. British Gas advised that even if the repair cost ¬£5.00 I would pay the full ¬£60.00 excess. 
I tried to explain then that this is a bit of a scam as not only are they taking my ¬£20.00 a month for the insurance but they are then making money on a repair that I have made. So in this instance my insurance was of no use as I had paid more in excess than what the repair cost British Gas. The would not accept this and just advised that even though the engineer was on site for a few minutes and he only tightened a bolt, not using any parts it is still a repair and as such I need to pay the ¬£60.00 excess.
I asked to speak to a manager and when the colleague came back to the phone he advised that someone would cal me back before 6pm. I advised that I was at work as 4pm so would wait, it was around 3pm at this point. He went to get a different manager and then came back advising that this one would call me back before 5:30pm. Again I advised that I was at work from 4pm but he advised that we are only doing call backs for complaints as we are busy and they needed to deal with customers issues. I challenged this as they had not dealt with my issue yet as I was being told I had to wait for upto 2.5 hours for a call back. Colleague at one point advised ""the managers are busy and have other things to do rather than speak to you"". Suffice to say I got nowhere on this call.
I did receive the call back later on but only got told the same. At one point it was said that the terms and conditions stated that I would pay the first ¬£60 of any claim. I advised that I accept this but if the claim did not come to ¬£60 surely I should only pay the amount up to this. No one seemed to understand the point I was making.
The long and short of this is that I will end up paying the ¬£60 excess although it is leaving a bitter taste that I am paying more in excess than the repair would have cost. I will not be renewing with them next based on this experience so far. I suggest that anyone taking out a Home Care agreement be aware of this as when you pay insurance you do not expect to be charged more in excess for any claim than the repair actually cost!

People should be aware British Gas use self employed contractors to fit systems and they are not always British Gas own employed engineers. I had the bad experience of having a contractor fit my central heating system and while doing so he flooded my lounge ceiling which had to be replaced. This caused a lot of stress and upheaval. The British Gas advert leads us to believe all engineers are employed directly by British Gas which is misleading.

We have had British Gas Homecare for 6 years and we haven't had a call out for over 3 years.  Now we have a problem with boiler failure, the fan on top of the boiler has burnt out therefore we have no heating or hot water.  We have been told that the earliest we can have an engineer visit is 10 days time as we could use our immersion heater for hot water however we have since found this does not work either. On telling them this was not acceptable we were told that we could get another Company to fix the problem and that they would contribute ¬£199 towards the cost.  We were also offered ¬£50 towards the purchase of fan heaters. Why bother paying for Homecare in the first place??? We also explained that we had elderly parents aged 92 and 94 due to visit for 4 days ,but in the eyes of British Gas this did not count. We are also pensioners and find this unacceptable service from a national company therefore we will be looking for a more efficient supplier.

British gas home care,
I have home care insurance with British gas,
I booked appointment for boiler service first time, engineer missed appointment to come

I booked again for boiler service, engineer missed appointment for second time also

I tried to call them they didn't lift the phone for 30 mins, ,

British gas home care is the worst , i would say less than one rating.

British gas service is not at all good,

Previously also i have similar experience with British gas to replace electric meter with no meter display, they taken 1 year to fix, i really didn't understand this much bad service in UK.

Have a Home Care plan on my home and a rented flat. I never had an issue with my home cover. Booked in the flat for a boiler safety check weeks in advance for between 8am and 6pm. Got a text message to say the engineer was on his way and I could track where he was. The time to arrival went from 5 minutes upto 25 minutes. He was actually driving away from me!!!! Couldn't get through on the phone...what an appalling service. Finally managed to have a open up a chat with customer service who said he was called to an emergency and wouldn't be carrying out the service today. Why have all the fancy tracking facilities if the engineer can't even be bothered to text or call me to say he won't be able to make it. Such a simple thing to do. I have cancelled both of my policies and will try another company. I do not see any responses from British Gas so I am assuming they don't care!!

I just can't understand how they manage to stay in business !
I complained and received an answer saying that 'the matter had been resolved' but it hasn't. I can only pay my account from my home telephone, not another as it links the phone number to the account. I think this is really bad, why can't I just type in my account number ? The new system. it offers no flexibility and there is no-one to talk to.

I am now moving house and there is a 30 minute wait for someone to talk to  (according to the automated voice) . Yes, and I'm paying for the call !!! I was given an option to give my telephone number for them to call me, but when would this be ? They should be faster than this.

Completed on my property which has pre-payment meters installed. Received conflicting advice about a credit check which I was told I needed in order to switch to credit meters. 

Initially I was told to wait 28 days and supply my addresses for the past 3 years. The next day I was told that I could do it there and then.

It was done automatically and I failed. I have an excellent credit rating with Experian and passed a credit check to get the mortgage to purchase the house.

I'm guessing that I may have failed because I have only just registered on the electoral roll at my new address - who knows because they did not give an explanation. God knows what my credit rating will be now!

I feel sorry for the staff who just read everything from scripts.

I am switching to another company having read the reviews on here, and hope I can escape BG in the nect 3 weeks

Moved into my property after over 6 months as busy with other things. British Gas cut off the electric without any notice. I did not use any of the electric or visit the property in this time, but they wanted over 700 pounds for standing charges before they would connect the meter again.

I set up a homecare plan with British Gas in August. Since then, I have booked 4 boiler services and none of these have actually happened.

With regard to the first service, the engineer phoned me to say that someone had ""gone into the back of his van"" and that he would not be able to come. Ok - can't be helped. He then ""rebooked"" this for the following day. Did anyone show up - no!

I had an online chat with one of the staff who booked in another service for a Friday morning. Did that happen - no. Apparently the appointment was left unconfirmed.

I then spoke to someone again and expressed my frustration - they apologised and booked a ""special slot"" on a Saturday in NOVEMBER. 

Knowing the service I had already received, I logged onto my account and could see that no upcoming appointments were showing. I did another online chat to try and resolve this and was treated appallingly. The agent was rude and unhelpful, putting exclamation marks at the end of her speech.

No understand, no empathy, and no customer service skills whatsoever. I have taken a total of 3 days off of work to stay in for services that have not ended up happening.

I have now cancelled my cover and am going to go elsewhere. I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND that people DO NOT deal with British Gas.

I was billed 9 months after leaving British gas, for an address that I no longer lived at, despite not being warned of any outstanding charges during this time. I now have to pay the full final bill on my own, as I am no longer in contact with the other tenants or the landlord. 
Perhaps it is my fault for not constantly checking my account (which I can't see even now because the system is being ""upgraded""), but this service is not built for people who rent or move frequently. It's drawn out and can be confusing.

I had to try to deal with British Gas to get a pay as you go meter changed. After one call to set up my account, I was told to call back the following day (SSE can do this on the same call). The phone number I had been given didn't work: It rang twice then hung up immediately. I tried the original customer service number, answered all the automated questions, got put on hold for ten minutes and was then handed to a human, who asked all the same questions, then put me on hold for another 10 minutes, and then I was cut off.

I've redialled the number and I'm currently five minutes into the hold music as I wait to start from scratch again.

As soon as they've installed the new meter at their expense I'll switch to a new provider.

I am now in the process of looking for a new energy supplier.  I have had to pay my bill as British Gas are now adding charges for non payment. This is very easy for them as I was waiting for them to resolve my complaint within the 21 days they say they will. However, they have not and the longer they hold back on a resolution the easier it is for them the make extra charges.  What does that say to you?

I have now hit another energy problem. Smart Meters. Despite companies saying you do not have to have one I am finding that you do.  I have an old Economy 7meter which I want to get rid of. I do not want a Smart Meter as I live in a flat and they seldom work properly as there is too much interference. This can result in estimated bills.

What you may ask mostly happens in a case like this? You are forced to retain your present supplier and system.  I am cash poor and time rich and like a challenge.

When I first posted on the site I said that the engineering aspect of British Gas was fine but the remainder chaos.  You only have to read these reviews to see I am right.  I repeat I was a satisfied customer for 4 decades but this was a different company then and if I had known that my recent complaint would be so poorly dealt with I would have changed suppliers years ago. There must be many senior citizens like myself who have never complained and assume that this is the solid British concern we used to know.  All I can say is that instead of sitting back we should be looking hard at other suppliers.

Stay far away from this company. I changed supplier because of their high prices and phoned to make my final payments. I was told that all was settled and the final bill had been paid off. 

A few weeks later I received threatening texts saying they were passing my details on to debt collectors if I didn't contact them. I phoned to see what the problem was and they told me that I had a ¬£567 electricity bill still to pay. I explained that we paid our final bills, then I was told that the agent I spoke with got it wrong. Now somehow we have a massive electric bill over the course of only 3 months and they're demanding we pay it, even though a verbal agreement was made with the first agent stating we had paid everything off already. 

No bills were sent in the post of emailed to us. Just 2 threatening text messages. The day I phoned and complained about the whole situation, I was then sent the bill by email that night. 

Every agent I spoke with, even managers had really poor customer service skills and even lacking general English skills. 

There's nothing British about this company. For your own good, stay far away. We changed to Octopus Energy. They're so much cheaper and their customer service is first class.

Have been a customer for 6 years and prices have crept up. Now that I actually have an issue that needs resolving, their service has been terrible. Promises to call back have not been fulfilled and there is no accountability for the really poor customer service. 6 weeks on, I still cannot get a commitment to send an engineer to sort my job. Unbelievable!

Once again British Gas‚Äôs customer service receives 0* rating from me. Despite numerous calls, emails, messages my situation remains the same as it did 3 days ago. Endless promises and nothing resolved. For a company that makes huge amounts of profit I question why they are unable to provide an adequate customer service to their customers. Web chats only over a weekend when most employed customers have time to contact British Gas. Customer service telephone services for prepayment customers appears to not be required over a weekend. My experience of the web chat that took place was shocking. False promises to resolve my problem and no further action taken place once the chat is ended. Sadly the same issue I‚Äôve had with the non response to emails and the false promises to resolve problems over the telephone also. I am sure Sarwjit Sambhi struggles daily with problems with his smart meter......I think not

I wouldn't give British gas 1 star if possible! Based on being with British gas for 6 months that I've been in new property, they have messed up 2 quarterly Bill's now despite me giving them my actual meter readings & the latest charging me over ¬£600 for 3 months in summer!!! I was with Scottish power for 11 years in my previous property & only paid between ¬£250-¬£300 for 3 months this is more than double that!!! Every plug is off when not in use only necessities are left on, fridge/freezer, phone line & 1 TV occasionally, 1 landing energy saving light at night, washing machine only used on weekend to do a few loads, no heating or tumble drier being used as its summer!!! How is this my bill??!! This property is all electric no gas. I've changed supplier now, any other company got to be better than this! This is beyond ridiculous, I wish everyone knew how robbing they are so they go out of business!

Home Care
Engineer repaired the washing machine 2 days later machine stopped working same fault code showing
Called British Gas Monday they said Engineer will attend Thursday 8-30-1-00 no one came rang BG they said they had called twice to inform of no show, total lie as no calls received or logged
So without the washer for 7 days at least
Paying good money for this service
Service is garbage and told lies by schedulers
Definitely looking at an alternative supplier for the future as this has happened twice now

Joke of a company. Installed smart meter without my consent and now bill has tripled. Rang to complain and phone was hung up first time, second time lady I spoke to did not really know what was happening. Have paid ¬£25 in 2 days and still credit on meter will soon run out. This is day light robbery, white collar crime at its best. You do not need a balaclava and a gun to be do robbery these days. Smart meter has no readings to show what I am using. How can this happen in modern day britain?

Appalling. I moved out of a premises 18 months ago and cancelled BG as they were so expensive. In the last month they have billed me twice and set the debt collectors on me for the new tenants' bill. Four phone calls, multiple tweets and nothing has changed. Average 30 mins on hold every time I call. Brusque and useless Twitter community managers. I am at my wits' end. My credit score has been affected. They just won't stop. Awful company - please avoid. There are so many superior and cheaper challenger companies you can go with these days.

I moved from boost to British Gas purely because boost only offer a ""pay as you go"" option. 

it took 2 months i was advised 2 weeks initially. i had to call weekly to progress the move and chase when an engineer would be able to swap the meters. 

i got passed from department to department. having to repeat my requirements again and again 

awful company to deal with. promised call backs were never received. the staff were ill equipped to deal with this simple move

the call times were horrendous and i spent over 30 minutes on every call i had to make to them and the engineer still didn't come out on the designated date and time

totally incompetent

Bad company, getting worse and charge whatever they like. We need more people on social media exposing their poor service. They charged me ¬£1725  for my gas,""accidentally"" which was removed with 3 month worth of investigation. They only took action after I had made a complaint & wanted the matter to be escalated.  

Simultaneously, they don't let me leave my electric supply to another company as they charge too much. Even though I had paid all the bills. Apparently they muddled up the date I was suppose too leave them that's why it was objected for a new supplier of electricity to take over. This went on for 3 month and still not solved by this time I have accumulated further 2 invoices.

British Gas broke into our new home when we had been in there six days. No warning to us, completely unnecessary, and are now forcing us to stay with them for another month before we can switch providers. Disgusted and outraged, we will never ever be using them again and urge others not to as well to prevent any other customers experiencing what we have.

I have never experienced a more dysfunctional company. With my previous tenancy, I tried to start both gas and electricity supply with a different supplier than British Gas. A mistake from British Gas with the bills to the previous tenant caused more than a year of headaches. The transfer to a better and cheaper supplier never happened. I ended up with only one solution which was to pay British Gas tariffs for the whole tenancy. One additional frustration was the continuous stream of letters (more than a hundred, I kept them all, sometime more than one per day. None of them based on reality).

I set my account up with British gas in 2010. in 2015 Scottish power made an erroneous transfer of my account. then billed the wrong address so I didnt realise. I went on paying my joint energy bill not realising the gas bill had been removed. on January 1st 2019 I had bailiffs turn up at my door for the full amount of ¬£2200.00. this was the first id heard of Scottish power or the bailiff company. I spoke with British gas and they said they would sort it out. 3 months later they deny I had ever had an account with them, then tried to trick me into taking out a new account. this would mean I would of had to pay Scottish power thousands that by law I now dont owe. Scottish power confirmed they would switch it back the moment British gas gets in touch, but like I said. now they are telling complete lies and deny I  was ever a customer. my bank details and emails in receipt of payment to them say different. Beware British gas, it is not a British company. their final response was 'go get a solicitor' leaving me with the prospect of having my door kicked in by bailiffs so they can relieve me of my goods to that value... im fuming!!!!!

British Gas charge you whatever they like when you take on someone else‚Äôs account temporarily. Then instead of charging the amount owed they charge you more so that they can give you a cheque refund of the balance, knowing very well that half there customers wont cash the cheque. Totally immoral institution that have no right to have the proud word British in their name. Why does the government not step in on practice such as this.

Regarding Gas Cert and Landlords Homecare package.
We've been BG customers on 2 properties since 2010 to 2019.  We have paid over GPB 6,000.  It's proven to be an absolute rip off as we never got value for services purchased and their service has simply deteriorated to appalling.  They need agents on site to let their technicians in (no BG - they are not engineers, they are technicians) because they will not pick up keys.  That's ok if their technicians would actually show up.  They think nothing of leaving our tenants without gas in winter.  And it is all about the repeat visit and extras.  After 9 years a cupboard installed in 2007 becomes an issue.   We have cancelled our contract with BG and would not consider using them again.  Trust this is helpful.

We were with British Gas for our business electricity.  When we tried to change suppliers in Dec 2018 we decided to ask the new supplier to invoice our Limited company rather than myself personally.  BIG MISTAKE.
BG decided to change the name on the account to the Ltd company name (despite never being asked to) with disastrous consequences.  I can't begin to tell you the confusion to the final billing process this has caused.  When you email BG you NEVER receive a reply.  When you call them, you seem to speak to a different person with a South African accent every time but no resolution.  Despite owing nothing we are still receiving debt collectors letters.  One star is one more than they deserve.

I have just had a combi boiler installed by British Gas to replace my back boiler. It was quite a big job to relocate and get a gas supply to the new location. I can't praise the engineers enough. They were polite, efficient and considerate. I was dreading having the work done as floor boards had to come up that were under my laminate flooring. Everything ran smoothly. These lads are a credit to British Gas. The new Hive control is amazing, so glad I took the plunge now before my old boiler died. Have been a British Gas customer for over 40 years, never had any major issues

On the 10/06/2019 at approximately 6.40 pm after returning home from work I noticed a lot of water coming in from my kitchen back door - there have been numerous issues with water that I have constantly reported and paid call out fees. I thought at least this could be solved this occasion. I called British Gas specifically stating I was worried and that because of my fridge being in that position some spark sounds were coming from there. To me this was an emergency and a huge risk to myself and the home.
I was told someone will be there within the next hour and that an engineer/ plumber will call me. I rang back at 7 then 8 and 9 and was told no call has been logged. I was devastated and by this time I had a power cut and had to go to a local pub to charge my phone. The call was then logged and I was then told later when I rang back that there was a call made/with a logged matter where an engineer/plumber will be with me shortly 
I mentioned to the lady on the final call that this was a serious issue - she stated she will log a complaint and that she will also call me by 10pm to see if it‚Äôs been sorted. This sounded a little reassuring at the time. She also mentioned that she will ensure that an electrician can look into this as I have been let down (she specified despite not having cover for my electric regarding home Care) that something will be done to solve the matter at least for today?  It is now 7am the next day I have had no calls or solution. I was also left at the home with no secure home alarm (ADT) so this was a cost I was paying with nothing happening.
The engineer eventually turned up at 10.20pm but it felt a lot longer.  It didn‚Äôt help at all when the plumber stated the water was coming from the back garden? To me this was very basic and not the work for a plumber to call out and see. I was able to see where the water was coming from, but needed a solution or some sort of plumbing work to be carried out. The plumber stated he is not a builder.  

When logging this matter for the additional time and not to mention delays/ being on hold possibly running up a telephone bill I did specify the urgency and state that due to no electric or lights the engineer/plumber will not be able to see anything - I was told they will have tools - I need to mention this plumber had no tools but a small torch saying he wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything as he can‚Äôt see. He continually asked me if this is my home and I was not happy in the dark with no solution- not to mention soaking kitchen floor, slipping over many times. My kittens were running around and the plumber kept leaving doors open when I did say the importance of them being shut as my kittens are not yet immunised. The whole evening was a complete shambles and I am truly devastated here.
I specifically mentioned all the above while logging the matter - not for no reason or ranting but to come to a proper solution. I felt that my whole evening was ruined , not to mention basic necessities completely destroyed when it could have been solved in a more better way (food/ lights/charging phone just to call British gas and be let down. I was also left with no choice but to go in a local pub where things took place just to charge my phone! awful experience and service 




Can we come to some sort of agreement here- I cant be left like this with no solution or help.

I have also asked that a member of the team comes to help me with submitting a reading and till this date nothing has happened. I am left with potential high bulls where I have had this incident occur so haven‚Äôt had the full use, while having family pay extra. 

I have had separate issues simply changing account holders has been a palaver and I have really been let down.

for the wonderful contribution they've made to the legalised business world of deceit, threats and distress.  Fortunately for me and after 22 months of suffering the brilliant art deceit, threats and distress from british gas, I've decided to believe they don't exist.

Complaint against British Gas

My customer number when with British Gas was - 851010505362

The issue began when we decided to change energy suppliers.  We contacted British Gas and began the process of submitting meter readings etc.   The 1st set of reading I submitted were declined and the reason was that the reading was very different than what was expected.  I then phoned and after a VERY lengthy process of being passed from one to another I was told the meter readings could not possibly be correct.  I confirmed them again over the phone and mentioned the fact they were from my smart meter.  The response I got was, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a smart meter!‚Äù  I was a bit perplexed as I was being told that what I was looking at in my sitting room was seemingly a figment of my imagination.  I assured British Gas that there was in Fact a smart meter and that it was British Gas who had installed it last year (Aug 2018).  The call was ended with the assurance that we would receive a phone call the following day with an explanation. A week later and no phone call!   I then called British Gas again...   Another VERY lengthy wait and call (again in excess of an hour).  The advisor again proceeded to inform me that NO smart meter had been fitted to our address.  After, AGAIN, going through the same brief as I had spent ages doing to the previous British Gas rep, this man was sympathetic and began asking the right questions.  I gave him the serial numbers from both Gas and Electric meters along with both the meter readings.  He informed me that the serial numbers were NOT what was recorded in their system.  Turns out we had new meters installed along with the smart meter.  Although British Gas has no record of this being carried out!  I assured the rep that all the work had been carried out by British Gas as they were our energy supplier.  The rep assured me that he personally would sort things and get back to me the following day.  The same outcome as before, 4/5 days laterI had to phone them for an update!  Guess what the process ended up being...   WELL OVER an hour again briefing yet another rep!!!!   This man was VERY unhelpful and harsh with me.  I was just about keeping my cool, however frustration was beginning to surface.  I ended the call with a request for a complaint to be lodged.  I was assured that someone would be in touch.  I received an Email stating that THEY had RESOLVED the issue and had addressed all my concerns.  THEY DID NOT ADDRESS ANY OF MY CONCERNS - and said they had closed the case!!!  

I am now left with many unresolved problems
 -  our new supplier has opened our new account based on British Gas ‚ÄúEstimates‚Äù for gas readings.
 - when I submitted readings to Bulb energy, they send the same response that British Gas used too - The readings are not accepted because they are way off their expected readings!!!
 - I have no way of knowing if I have been ripped off by British Gas as for the last year they have been going on ‚Äúestimated‚Äù readings.  
 - all our four girls left home during that year and we know our usage was dramatically reduced when they left home!!
 - there is a massive difference between the ‚Äúestimated‚Äù readings  and actual.  Actual readings are round 3000 lower than estimated ones on both meters.

Since the ""Smart meter's"" have been fitted we had nothing but trouble, we have not been credited our balance from the old meters as promised, the website does not work, the app is impossible and you are left without a viable way of topping up your account and left ultimately without gas and electric. The customer service is void and you just get passed to other departments and other advisors where they ""look"" into your complaint then fill you with empty promises, or you just ignore you. The facebook page is filled with complaint's and the advisors on their social media sites are pretty arrogant or continue to ask irrelevant questions without actually reading the complaint's. I have lived in many third world countries and received better service than this 'British Corporate"" company that seems to be stuck in the dark ages where customer service and competence is concerned. We are now stuck with this poor excuse for an energy company as the more competent companies do not take on client's with these dreadful ""Smart meters"" I just hope this helps others whom are thinking of switching to the smart meters. Switch provider while you still can don't be left without energy like we constantly are!

Homecare package is not what it seems its ¬£60 extra for each and every callout.


Having a leak from the plastic pipe connecting my boiler to the outside drain pipe. I stupidly thought that this sort of issue would be covered under my top Homecare package. Well it was not unless I wanted to pay ¬£60 excess for this and any other call out. ¬£60 for a rubber sleeve is nothing less a cowboy type ripoff. Its about time they gave there engineers horses and triangular hats shouting stand and deliver on arrival. So if you are thinking about Homecare package, think again it only covers what you think it covers if you agree to give them ¬£60 to walk through your door. Its a call out charge pure and simple so why not say it up front when you are buying this product. 

Because once you are on the hook they will have you for every penny they can squeeze out of you, also bear in mind before accepting you for Homecare they insist on a full inspection to insure they are only covering stuff unlikely to breakdown, I could accept a excess charge for faults and repairs over ¬£200 but ¬£60 for a rubber connector is outrageous. I'll try fixing it myself or I'll rather pay an independent who I trust to fix it at a sensible price.

Annual Homecare check yesterday.  After about 10 minutes, engineer went to boiler controls (upstairs)to get boiler to fire up. Came back to boiler in kitchen and announced that the boiler would not ignite and he had to over-ride with switch on boiler. Said that ,meant over-heating but switched on and as it ran for another 10 mins. decided it was OK.  When the auto control should have come on in the evening, nothing happened. I checked the digital control upstairs and found that he had switched all controls to ""off"". No wonder he couldn't get the boiler to flash up.

Crazy company. I‚Äôve never been a BG customer yet I was billed for gas usage when I was paying another company. I contacted them to clear things up and they turned it into a can of worms. Repeatedly they attempted to take over my supples without my consent from another big energy supplier. What a mess. In the end I submitted a complaint and escalated it to the ombudsman. It was then corrected but not after repeated communication with the ombudsman as they didn‚Äôt quite understand what had happened. In the end BG was at fault. They kept on saying not their fault right upto the end. What a nightmare! An expensive company that does not listen to anyone as they believe they are always right.

I highly recommend a different company for electric or gas. British Gas is unprofessional and cannot be bothered about their clients. I‚Äôve disputed my bill and was told that I will get a call back. For a week I called twice a day and on ever call I was told that someone will call me back. The 1st few consultants didn‚Äôt even make a note of the query on the account so my 1st 4 calls, I had to repeat the myself and what the issue was but every time I will get the same answer, we will call you back but 2 weeks later. I‚Äôm still waiting for the call back. I‚Äôve logged a complain via their website but still nobody got back to me. Instead late payment fees and debt collecting charges was added even tho I‚Äôve been waiting on British Gas to get back to me. I never said that I wasn‚Äôt going to pay but the bill is disputed and they cannot explain why the bill was so high but continue to put late payment fees even tho I‚Äôve been waiting on them to get back to me. Extremely poor customer service. This is now been escalating to trading standards but yet even informing British Gas that I will escalate this issue they still couldn‚Äôt be bothered to get in contact with me, instead I just received an statement via email with more fees added. 
STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THERE IS ALLOT OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT WILL GIVE YOU BETTER SERVICE.

As a home owner currently wondering why one still maintains a Home Care contract with such a dysfunctional and inept service provider, my wife and I have yet again had another appalling experience with a company which one could never in all honesty recommend. 

As usual the communication with the company reflected a standard of organisational ineptitude which is staggering. To underline the standard of customer care which one now has come to expect from a company whose central philosophy is not to put the customer first, we were told this morning by their ""planning department"" and one uses the term advisedly, that we could always take our business to a third party.  We have now cancelled the electrical work on our kitchen lights and placed our business with a trusted electrician. 

The standard of British Gas customer care has in our opinion been evidently declining over the last year or so. We have experienced their regular ability to cancel arranged call outs at the last moment. On one occasion I recall waiting for a call out (Which required me to take the morning off work) only to find that the job had been independently cancelled because they didn't have the staff. Significantly, I had to contact them to elicit the information after waiting in and re-organizing my office schedule to accommodate their failure. Naturally my wife and I have enjoyed their compensation terms on a regular basis but that only reflects the quite staggeringly poor service.

I am now of the opinion that entering into a British Gas Home Care contract is a waste of money, at that one would be better advised to make regular monthly savings into one's own bank account to call out reliable professionals as required.

When I tried to book one they said it is not included as I am on a different tariff (than the one my account quotes!) and need to google different T&C's! I could book a service through my HomeCare but they will charge me ¬£99 pounds. If I didn't have the HomeCare it would be.... ¬£79!!!! I had a smart meter fitting cancelled on the day due to overrun on the previous customer - OK, stuff happens. They said they would compensate me (¬£30) for having taken the day off work (daily pay ¬£240!) and rescheduled my appointment. Another day off work and the engineer arrived but said he would not do the work as it was raining! No mention of this when booking the appointment and - had they called me beforehand as they say they will I could have gone to work. Again another ¬£30 compensation offered. No compensation has appeared on my account. I cannot raise another complaint as I already have one open - BG limits people to only one complaint at a time... that keeps the numbers down for OFGEN! All I now want them to do is waive the early cancellation fee (if they actually paid all the compensation they said they would it is less than the cancellation fees anyway!) so I can switch to a decent provider. AVOID British GAS!

absolutely the WORST customer service I have ever had the misfortune of enduring. Tried to resolve an issue with erroneous transfer via chat 3 weeks ago and was assuered it was sorted, now my account has been closed in error, called to sort out again, kept on hold for 24 minutes then put through to another person that had no idea of my call. I will be leaving after this appalling customer service.  Should be ashamed to have British in your name!

BRITISH GAS LIARS,SCAM AND RIP OFF
British Gas both supply and maintenance is a total rip off and they are scamming customers.
They state that they service and check your boiler with an annual service and they check that your central heating is in good working order. 
This is totally untrue they don't check your central heating at all.
That makes it a scam because they falsely advertise it as part of the annual service. 
Mine was supposedly checked and signed off by them however 3 valve leaks occurred in a very short time one the same leak twice causing considerable damage to a newly decorated kitchen.
They try to say they are not responsible, but the damage was caused by sheer incompetence of their lazy engineer who did not check the central heating system at all.
Their policy also states accidental damage is included.
I would like to know how they are checking a central heating system is in good working order without so much as turning it on and checking each radiator is hot and does not need bleeding.
This is false advertising by them and a scam to con people out of money.
Many people have stayed with them years because they think it is a hassle to change but it is very easy to change suppliers.
It‚Äôs actually very easy and can be done with a simple phone call to any other supplier. 
British gas also is ripping people off on the cost of gas and electric.
Standing charges and unit charges are much cheaper with other suppliers there are now many.
Don‚Äôt think they treat loyal customers of many years any different because they do not
British gas is a rip off company who could not care less about their customers.
According to the press British gas are losing nearly 100000 customers a month as people wake up to better service and prices from other suppliers.

British Gas are totally useless and a waste of space .
My report now goes to the financial ombudsman .
My assessment of the situation is exactly what happened. 
British Gas was given every opportunity to sort the situation out amicably and after dealing with them locally they failed to even respond to a complaint letter sent to head office.
The sheer arrogance of this company is unbelievable and don't be fooled by there false advertising.
My advice is keep clear of this scam company.
They also after 2 weeks still have not returned an overpayment of ¬£160 if next week l still don't receive it l will issue county court debt proceedings against them.
I terminated both my accounts with them and changed suppliers on 25th March.
2weeks ago they said I would receive a cheque in 3 -5days MORE LIES!
I spoke to these incompetent fools again today they have not even processed my refund they just told me it will be another 10 days.
The way this company now operates is totally beyond belief.
What a totally ridiculous reply from British gas had the incompedent engineer tested the system to be be in a safe working condition as per British Gas advertising he would have found the leak but as he failed to check the system was in a safe working condition he did not find it .As previously stated how is BG checking a Central heating system properly without even switching it on ?lt is a ludicrous reply which by the way is also supposedly covered for accidental damage so either way British Gas are responsible.The amount of bad reviews this lousy company has just goes to prove how bad they really are.

Home Care Boiler Plan 
Bookings cancelled at last minute on scheduled time slot ..
Happened to me three times the third today although I have taken a day off .
British Gas do not state this at time of the booking that there is a chance your booking will have to be rescheduled  on the booking slot you are making as other emergencies may arise Boch take priority over your broken boiler ..

Have a Hime care plan with British Gas and I  booked an engineer out as my boiler was not functioning and kept switching off with a fault ..I phoned for an appointment and was asked if anyone had a medical condition and  he was informed that my husband had a bad chest infection at the moment but this was not thought of an emergency call out and do was offers a booking for two days later .iI booked for an appointment today between 12 and 6 pm .
I had two missed phone calls within 20 minutes on my mobile around 2pm  and upon ringing the number back the number had a recording advising it was ‚ÄòBritish Gas ‚Äòand it‚Äôs not urgent and will call soneother time .
I myself then rang up British Gas to find out why I had a call whether it was to do with my repair and was told ‚Äòyes ‚Äòit was to do with a reschedule as other people took priority over my appointment as they had medical conditions ,so we have been without heating  four days with my husbands chest infection  ongoing yet that‚Äôs not counted as someone who is a priority but on the scheduled appointment have been kicked off to ‚Äòreschedule ‚Äòthe appointment after having taken time off work .
There is a bank holiday so my appointment would have been rescheduled for when I could get time off again in a weeks time .
After complaining I have been offered ¬£30 for broken appointment and an engineer has been rescheduled again for today don‚Äôt know  what time for an emergency as I have now told them again husband  still has chest infection and has medical condition .The reason why I have been cancelled and rebooked as emergency is I failed to tell them that he also had a medical condition apart from his chest infection .The chest infection on its own is not a ‚Äòhigh risk ‚Äòaccording to them .
This is not the first time they have done this either to me ..It‚Äôs happened before so saying it only happens occasionally does not sit with me .
My complaint is why when I have taken time off work have I been cancelled at the last minute to make appointment for somebody else ? Surely this should be pointed out at the time of booking the appointment that although ‚Äòwe are booking this appointment your appointment may be cancelled at the last minute due to an emergency elsewhere ‚Äò

When one takes a  homecare contract out with them one should be informed of this then as well .
For this I have to award British Gas ‚Äòone‚Äô star and am sure it will keep happening .I am not the first and the last to happen to .
The engineers themselves are excellent it‚Äôs just the office staff making these appointments that are  to blame and the management for letting it happen .
British Gas is a large company and can afford to employ enough engineers to do the emergency call outs .

I am paying an excess of ¬£60  a repair as well so it‚Äôs not like it was a free repair .

Head Management need to listen to the customers to avoid making changes to these last minute reschedules .

Ah British Gas ! Years ago I moved from Eon to British Gas because they promised me to upgrade my electric unit, 10 years down the line, have they done so? NO; I had a vaillant bran new combi BG totally broke, one can still see the trace on the outside bricks, during a yearly check one of their engineers broke one of the pipes and water was pouring down, another engineer then came and put a label saying dangerous, they left me in the cold for more than 2 weeks during winter, I am an elderly, after their repairs it was never the same the combi wanted more water but when one opened the valved it then regurgitated by the outside overflow pipe, I only got 200 compensation.  I now had to buy a new combi and no british gas will not touch it, I am now also leaving them.  As far as I am concerned they are one of the worst organisations, full of pretentious claims with nothing to prove they are able.

Absolute theives! Moved into a new build apartment which was electricity only, British Gas was the supplyer. We decided after 1 month to find a cheap supplyer as we knew BG was a dear company, after we started with a new supplyer we received an estimated bill from BG of ¬£113 for the month. I rang them and said I don‚Äôt want an estimated bill as I‚Äôm no longer with you,I‚Äôd like a final true bill and not a guess. They said they would get back to me with a final bill ASAP. A couple of more weeks went by and then I received a letter off a debt collecting agency with a late payment fee on as well as charges for the debt collectors. I rang BG and they said the first bill I got was a final bill even though it said estimate on it and I was promised a final bill. I seeked advice and was told I‚Äôd have to pay, including the late payment fee even though it was not my fault. Absolute daylight robbery, myself or any of my family will never go near this dreadful company again. Disgusting!

Recently moved to British Gas (Nov 18), signed up early Jan 19 for the smart meter install for both Gas & Electric. Engineer booked for the 15th March. Took a day off work, and the engineer never showed up. 
Spoke to the idiots at the call centre who initially sent they had no record of the planned date, then after I kicked up a fuss they suddenly found the booking and offered no explanation as to why they cancelled it but told me to take another day off work so that they could 'plan' (but not guarantee!) a new installation. Told them no, they have to install either on a evening or at the weekend at times that suite me and not the other way around - they refused to do this, so i'm now going to take my business elsewhere - shocking service yet not really surprised based on the reviews here!

One star because you can't leave 0 stars.

We're told in moving to new property in June that we couldn't have a smart meter fitted because of the positioning of the gas meter within the house  - we thought fair enough thay makes sense. So agreed on quarterly payments.

The last contact we have had in any form from this shower of idiots was one bill from November.

So imagine out surprise on Monday when we arrived home to find our locks had been taken off TWO door and a PREPAYMENT METER installed with no previous contact by letter, phone call or email. No warrant provided, no details of an application for said warrant and the relevant court proceedings for us to contest it. No payment plan offered absolutey NOTHING.

Not to mention where have they installed it... in the exact place we were told wasn't suitable for a smart reader because it is UNREADABLE at the height it is. Even with our large stepladders you have to navigate under one door frame and continue up into the gap between the external porch door and the internal flat door - not exactly convenient.

No prepayment card left for us or sent out, no leaflet provided so what happened when we'd arrived home at 8pm - THE GAS HAD RAN OUT. Called the first gent was sympathetic but just suggested we had to go out and buy a card and top up. So there we go it's now 8.30pm and I've had to trail round numerous stores with my two year old finding one of your cards for it to be registered then on getting it up the road to start it in the meter it doesn't work. Then managed to reach someone absolutely helpful who was APPALLED at the situation we'd been left in given my other half has two medical conditions that we could contest on having a prepayment meter fitted in the first place and we also have a young child. Also said rht this is the normal proceeding for arrears that have been going on for a year or more... weve only been with this disgusting company since June. She was able to send an engineer out within the hour who was very pleasant and he himself couldn't understand why we had been fitted with one of these godawful things and were being left in the s*** basically because nobody bothered getting back to us on Monday (systems are down you can't speak to anyone at all).

Will be contacting today and fully intend on taking this further. Not that we'll get anywhere because the majority of the company sound like a bunch of yes men to the money grabbing powers that be up the top.

I recently had a boiler installed and an additional radiator with the hive system. I have to say that the whole process was excellent. The engineers both the plumber and electrician treated my home with respect. They explained the process and also kept me updated. They cleaned up afterwards. I did have an issue the next day but this was expected as the additional radiator needed balancing again an engineer arrived who sorted it out and was extremely polite. The difference the new boiler has made is great. The heating system is functioning extremely efficiently and the house is really warm. I would recommend the replacement boiler to anyone as you may get it a bit cheaper but you don't have the backup and the professionalism. I think it was worth every penny.

I am appalled by how British Gas has been scamming me over the last year. I live in a 1bed flat alone. I have a broken boiler that has not worked for over 2-3yrs. I hardly cook and I am away a lot at the weekends. I am out at work all day every day. My tariff used to be less than a ¬£100 every 3 months for over 5 years. Since then they have put me on a fixed contract for about ¬£74 a month. 6 months ago they claimed that I owed almost ¬£300 due to their error in meter reading between 2-3 months IN THE SUMMER TIME. I refused to pay it because: 
1. They did not write to me to inform me of their error 
2. They didn't explain how I consumed so much energy when I am consuming even less since having a broken boiler... This month they have charged me over ¬£200 and I have been told that my monthly energy bill will be ¬£210 a month. 

Can someone please make it make sense? I am switching to another company but I just wanted to warn all of you. British gas is a scam. I can no longer trust them. Worst company ever!

Last week, I provided my meter reading for British Gas for both electricity and gas. I am on a combined energy supply but then received a bill on 26/02 for solely gas. On 27/02, I received two more bills: one for gas, with a different figure than the previous day's, and another for electricity. I contacted  British Gas who were unable to help me, saying they would look into it and contact me today (28/02) at 5pm. 5pm came and went and so I had to ring British Gas myself. 50 minutes later, and I was told that they were working on my account so could not provide me with more information - but will supposedly ring me back. The operator could, however, tell me that I should have received a combined bill and not two separate ones... 

Given that they were unable to ring me at 5pm today to say this, I do not trust that I will be receiving a phonecall this evening.

My mother died suddenly last April and I handled probate. Although her account was with Sainsbury energy, it's really British Gas behind the scenes. When it came to completing probate after selling her house, I gave the final electricity and gas readings. I was told that I was due a refund, which didn't surprise me as my mother had the heating on 24 / 7 and for 6 months I just had it ticking over for a couple of hours a day. They issued the refund, I completed the probate accounts, dished out money to beneficiaries and drew a line under it. I then got a bill, which I ignored as I assumed it was an error, followed within days by a threatening letter from BG about retrieving the money. I wrote a complaint letter which also asked why was I given a refund if the estate still owed money? This was sent to appropriate people at Sainsbury and BG. No response. I then complained to BG via their website. You get an automated response saying they will respond in 3 days. No response, so I sent the complaint in every day for 3 weeks. No response. After an extremely stressful year dealing with my Mother's death, handling probate and having to deal with a nasty money grabbing relative, I didn't need this unnecessary stress from BG.

Someone from Sainsbury eventually phoned me today. It turns out that BG ""forgot"" to bill the estate for 2 months, the refund should have only been for a couple of quid and therefore I had to pay the rest. I explained that probate was completed and the bank account closed and surely as it was their fault they'd write it off. No, and the only compensation I'd get - sorry ""gesture of goodwill"" was ¬£20. 

I have had confirmation in writing from them that (1) they used estimates to close the account - even though I'd given them the final readings (2) They got the dates wrong and (3) I was given incorrect information, and they still get off scot-free. There is no ""punishment"" for being incompetent.

So I am going to have to pay the bill as the other beneficiaries won't chip in. I am frankly disgusted that due to an error on their part, BG is hounding me for the money, and won't take any responsibility for their incompetence, especially when dealing with a dead customer's account. Shame on you BG. Shame on you.

I last made payment to my account October 2018 for ¬£68.61. This was a reduced value where previously I had been paying more on a payment plan set up by yourselves. I made my payment monthly, confirmed by checking the balance online. 

Nov, Dec and Jan balanced showed zero at which point I made an enquiry to you regarding the balance. I received an email from agent Sachin Pagare on 14th January stating the balance was zero and they would bill me soon.

I have now received a bill for ¬£334.17. 

I called this evening to discuss this and spoke to an agent called  Shianay? Her explaination was something along the lines of if a customer asks how much they owe they are told zero until a bill is generated. So, of no use at all in actual fact. If I ask how much I owe you for the energy I have used, I expect to be given an accurate balance/amount owing. What is the point of a monthly plan? And when did you tell me that this would change? 

When I took umbrage to this explanation the agent said it sounded like I was trying to get out of paying my bill. When I challenged this, she disappeared off the call and disconnected.

Soon after moving into my home, a letter from British Gas arrived in someones name. I returned the letter stating "" not known at this address"".  Unknown to me at the time, it was a letter confirming a switch. I only realized this when my  energy supplier telephoned me. They said they were unable to stop the switch, and I would have to call BG and explain there has been a mistake. I called them and they said they would only speak with the person named on the letter. I explained I had no knowledge of him and he most certainly does not live at the address. They would not accept this. I informed them that I was the owner and will only pay for bills in my name and suggested they put an end to the switch.. They refused claiming a request has been made. I told them if they wont do as I request, which is correct, then there is nothing further I could do. I was not planning on arguing with them or wasting time on the telephone at my expense. In the meantime my supplier was on my back and I was stuck in the middle. After more calls to BG ( my supplier kept saying I have to sort out the mess)  , they agreed saying someone requested the switch at my address in error. The woman stated "" well, it can happen"" to which I said "" well  you could thought that when I told youd in the first place, but you chose to harass me"". She offered ¬£10 for my time and call expenses. I, not so politely told her where she could place that tenner, and the sun wont shine on it, ever. What an insult after causing so much distress and wasting so much of my time. BG is rubbish and I will never be a customer of theirs even if they were the cheapest. Horrible company and they recruit staff to match. I was never a customer, and never intended to contact them. I was drawn into the mess.  Such is life that a big company like BG can easily harass people who have nothing to do with them even, and they offer a pittance to compensate their mistreatment of someone simply going about their own business, not looking for problems, nor doing anything to create problems.

Booked a ""one off repair"" for 8am to 1PM online. Called at 11, to check as I had not heard. They had ""lost"" my booking (despite the confirmation email being in Junk mail) then told me engineer was late. At 1 I called and Egineer had cancelled me as he had no time, replacement would be out by 15.30

Called at 16.00, and no engineer booked to come out. 

This all for the low cost of ¬£89.00

I would like to say how delighted I am with the service I received from Scottish Gas today, 11/02/05. I had an annual boiler inspection conducted by Nigel.  Not only was he was very thorough in his inspection of the boiler and radiators, he also took time to answer my questions about various aspects of central heating in a very friendly manner. He was professional, knowledgeable and efficient and an absolute credit to the firm. Oh and a bonus is the price I paid was much cheaper than advertised on their website!

I had a homecare plan with British Gas. had an appointment with an engineer on tuesday followed my night shift between 8-12. had to wait to be told there were no engineer coming to my home but one will attend in the afternoon but still nobody turned up. they gave me the next appointment the following friday from 8-6pm. Had to wait for the whole day and nobody turned up. Called BG 3 times during the day and was reassured that the engineer were on their way. final phone call after 6pm and the customer service advised me that the job has never been sent out. i am really disappointed for the service.

customer service a joke. Basically boiler broke down on Saturday evening could not get an engineer to fix the problem until Monday between 8am and 6pm he turned up at 6.10pm he did ring to let me know he was on his way fair play to him. he then spent about hour trying to fix it explained what he had done. Great all working again although i thought until this morning Wednesday same thing again broke down same problem again no water or heating rang them cant get to us before Thursday morning between 10am and noon explained i have been without hot water and heat for 2 days this week already now you expect me to go without again for another day instead of coming out to fix the problem you should have fixed a few days before appalling service what am i Paying for BG? If you advertise a product you need to ensure you have the man power to fill the customers expectations you wont be getting my custom next year. They have offered me a one off payment of ¬£30 for inconvenience ill take it but its not about the money its the service i have paid for and expect that i want in future.

As a Landlord I care greatly about the safety & speedy service to my tenants. To help fulfill this I have had Service contracts with BG Services for 20 Years. There have been minor problems many times but my latest experience has been the proverbial straw. Three times I was assured that electrical work, carefully explained to the staff, would be carried out under my contract. I was even promised that a note to that effect would be passed to the electrician. Yet he refused to do the work. This was also linked to a number of failed appointments. My enquiries over weeks to this and a boiler matter brought  promises of call backs which were never fulfilled. I made an official complaint. After 2!months I have been issued with a letter apologising for false information given, admitting to failures to respond but still not giving me essential information on the results of an electrical fault on the boiler. I'm thoroughly disillusioned . The contracts cost me over ¬£2000 per year! But probably not to them next year!

Worst energy supplier ever! Do not go near them with a 20-ft pole. We switched to another supplier and disputed the final meter reading British gas handed out.

Do not Trust British Gas, I am flabbergasted by the fact British Gas have come up with an old bill from 2016 that I assumed was settled,when we transferred to Sainsbury's, no correspondence or reminders, just a text from a foreign call center 3 years later threatening late payment charges & reporting me to debt collection agencies,even though we are still with them via Sainsbury's, so what took them 3 years, just outrageous and to make matters worse they have reported me to credit agencies so it goes against my credit rating. And to add insult to injury their engineers failed to turn up on two occasions to fit a new meter, and all they do is say sorry and offer ¬£30.00 odd pounds off a 3 year old bill I did not know still existed completely unacceptable.

I was kept waiting over the phone for over 25 mins to sort a problem out. I was then told that he could sort this out by giving me transaction credit. But i had to speak to 5 different staff before him. I dont like being past from pillow to post nor do i like to be kept waiting over the phone for a long time. I had to then go to the same shop 5 different times which caused me great problems the co op staff wasnt at all pleasant to me i felt because of british gas and british gas kept sending me backwards and forwards to co op with the same gas card all i wanted was ¬£10 gas i ended up having to call british gas 5 times in the space of 4 hours to sort this out. The texts i received from british gas confused the co op staff and confused me. This should have been done a lot more better.

Disaster after disaster over many years, they are unreliable, contradict themselves, downright give wrong information and refuse to provide any sort of reasonable customer service.

Having tried to hike my annual HomeCare cost by more than 25% but then agreeing to ‚Äúallow me‚Äù to continue paying more than ¬£300 for the privilege, two months later I learn they have cancelled my account. Learning this fact itself was not easy; I spoke to three different customer service executives, being passed from one to another without warning, only to be cut off by the last. I then resorted to on-line chat but, eventually, realised this was futile as I was communicating with someone who either had not a clue what to do or who was trained in customer frustration tactics (I have the transcript to prove it!). Anyway, the point is that British Gas HomeCare is without doubt the worst company with which I have ever had the misfortune to engage.

I've been a BG Homecare customer for over 30 years and feel compelled to comment on their ever decreasing customer offer.  Firstly there is the annual pantomime of the renewal process where they unsuccessfully attempt to increase my premium by +30%.  The most recent farce involves booking a service.  Having received both an email reminder and a prompt on my customer account web page from British Gas, I find that the next available appointment is the 12th of March, two months away.  Apparently there is a shortage of engineers and ""they're very busy just now|"".

This and the annoying habit of increasing and then dramatically decreasing my monthly direct debit despite my account being always in credit has finally persuaded my to change suppliers for both my energy requirements and Homecare.

There is just another case where customer loyalty is not appreciated.

I have BG Home care have done for 8 years first time call out week before xmas and told need new exchange unit.  Came to fit it and did not seal pipes flooded my house.  2nd eng came to fix it broke the front panel on boiler and blew electrics.  3rd eng came to service it not to fix it. 4th eng tried to fix it but broke it even more and said he would order parts.  5th eng said no parts had been ordered and fixed it by applying black gaffer tape to it.  6th eng was very apologetic tried his best got it all working and said he couldn't get the parts to fix it.  Raised an official complaint told will contact me in 48hrs. A week later and no contact was made so I rang them back and was told I will defiantly be contacted within the next day.  That was a week and 1/2 ago.  Just rang again and they still had not processed my complaint.   Please do not use British Gas customer service worst I ever experienced.  Engineers Skill very Poor.  Complete waste of money.  So from a Boiler that was not working the central heating to a complete mess and completely broken boiler all over Xmas.

would give them a zero star if the option was available.Have appliance  breakdown insurance with been with them 3years or so on recommendation of friends.Never needed to call them until my washing machine broke down on 21st December,rather than mess about on the phone booked the appointment online.This appointment was for 3rd Jan.between hours of 8am -1pm.Well 1pm came and went.2pm came and went.Then at 230pm i spoke online (via chat live)on my account.First of greeted with good evening since when was 230pm evening in the uk so reminded this person it was afternoon in uk.Really useless speaking to them.Then spoke to another person who did actually get Mark from british gas to phone me at 320pm.Mark assured me that their had been a mix up my appointment wasn't the morning one i had waited for but because it had been contracted out to ANS it was an all day appointment and they had left a message on Tylers phone for him to get back to me with ETA,but rest assured an engineer would be with me before 6pm,and due to the fact this engineer was possibly busy fixing someone elses appliance or even driving and that could be why they haven't got back to me.Well 6 pm came and went and yes you got it no one turned up.7pm called british gas again engineer could still call but if you feel it's too late call us back and we will rebook your appointment.Contacted online live chat again number given for ANS call them leave message (still no call back from them) spoke via social media its A & S another company number given call them no joy there either. At 830pm called them again this time getting through to Isabelle,very polite and trying to be helpful,she doesn't think the engineer will call now so she will start raising a complaint and rebooking an appointment.Comes back with the appointment 15th January asked her if she was having a laugh 4 weeks without a washer how do i do my washing for the previous 2 weeks ? take it to a dry cleaners how do i get it there where is there a dry cleaners locally to me?The cost of dry cleaning.Puts her manager on who just as useless as what Isabelle was again reiterating the same date for an appointment reschedule.Utter useless and a waste of my day and time,my complaint had been submitted and someone will contact me about it.If i like i can phone up at 8am to see if there is an earlier appointment..At 1030pm (ish) my appointment is still showing on my account and still showing that it was still going ahead.So 7am today get online to my account spoke again to chat adviser who let it slip that my appointment was never going to happen because due to issues with the system.So they knew yesterday that no one was going to call to fix my washing machine but decided to use that little old chestnut of LIES.Still waiting for complaints to get in touch with what they are going to do to rectify this matter.If anyone is thinking of taking out British Gas appliance cover don't avoid at all costs.Rogues and LIARS.On social media trying to fob me off with they do not lie biggest joke of all time.

BG engineer burst our main water pipe while fixing our heating, in the night flooded our new kitchen through the ceiling electrics and side units. Took almost two days to fix after 5 different engineers turned up saying they didn't have the tools!! no working toilet or hot water for almost two days!  absolutely atrocious  service from British gas home care. The final guy was from Dyno, he was brilliant didn't have to smash up our new bathroom tiles to access the pipe as I was told by other engineers! this caused so much stress, we lost money on pre paid for events having to keep waiting in for someone else to arrive from BG only to be told he didn't have the tools again! and apparently he was told to come to us anyway even though he told BG he didn't have the tools and he wouldn't be able to fix the problem!

I am having my kitchen floor tiled.  I have a stand alone gas cooker and am a British Gas customer.  The cooker has a very short chain so I will need to have the cooker disconnected to enable the tiler to get to where the it stands.  I will then need the same cooker reconnected.  British Gas have just quoted me ¬£73.53 to have the cooker disconnected and then a further ¬£110.29 to have the same one reconnected.  Yes, very nearly ¬£200!  This is more than the actual tiles cost!! Shame on the greedy British Gas and entirely irresponsible of them too as I think some people might try to do the job themselves and could put themselves and others at risk.

Leaving BG, very disappointing service
We have currently moved in to a property with smart meters. I have called BG to asks them to switch off the smart function or revert the meter to a traditional one as it is interfering my relative's pacemaker. The customer service was unhelpful and patronizing. I am so disappointed with their customer service. Will switch to a different supplier. I have cancelled my insurance with them too.

British gas are the biggest joke of a company to deal with,  only that the outcome of dealing with them was no joke. We have been left with no gas over the last two weeks, making christmas a VERY cold one with no hot food.  Had british gas done their job properly, everything would have been fine. But as they fitted us with a new (broken) meter and we were unable to top up. They have been round 4 times in the last week to put emergency gas on our meter but the top-up problem still isn't fixed.

Simply shambolic!!
Homecare boiler cover and customer service quite shambolic!!
Repair job not properly done in the first place led to boiler breaking down the very next day and again after few weeks! Had to call my own plumber as BG would not send an engineer till the Monday leaving a family with no boiler for the whole weekend.
When the boiler broke down again after a few weeks a different BG engineer attended and was meant to come back the following day with the part that should have been replaced in the first place. Guess what? He couldn't as he received the wrong part! When he finally turns up a few days later with the right part guess what? He manages to change it but another part which was perfectly fine before he puts his hands on it, breaks down. So he replaces that one too but guess what? Another part breaks down and guess what? He doesn't have it in his van because coincidence he used it the previous day and didn't replace it! So he has to order it and has to come back the following day leaving us with no heating and no hot water! I ask to borrow an electric heater but guess what? Roo much to ask....He hasn't got one in his van!
I have complained to BG customers service and a Mr Shah from the Leicester team promise 100% to call me back on the 12th of December after one of the several engineer's visit but guess what?? I'm still waiting despite I called them again on the 14th to enquire about my complaint.
So not just incompetent engineers but also appalling customers service.
Well done British Gas! Won't recommend to anyone!!

Its a shame you cannot pick '0' stars! Awful service - or lack of! As some of the other reviews here state - took a day off work for an annual boiler service - first one after taking out the cover, told engineer would arrive between 8 and 1, no update online just constantly says 'in your area' call up to chase after no one turned up, and I was told that I was the next job but the agent would check for me,  then told after being on hold, that the job had to be cancelled.  The agent was polite and it was not her fault, although complete lack of customer service with no communication in regard to the cancellation and a day off work wasted.

7 days still not hot water & NO update for 3 days now...

After waiting patiently for 4 appointments (over 28 hours of waiting), I am still without hot water. I also have explained I have a medical condition which makes me more prone to this problem.
The job is not even a complex one. I am tempted to just sort it out privately for ¬£100 or so.

-  I have had to call British Gas 12 times so far. 
- On Friday I pushed to speak to a manager. The manager apologised and promised to call me back but he did not. 
- I chased up yesterday (a 43 minutes long call), they apologised again, but again failed to call back with an update.

It is Sunday now, still no hot water or update. Not what I expected after paying for the most expensive homecare cover for over 18 months. 

The worse thing is its not even a complex job, 2 commonly available parts need replacing.

Given I have a medical condition, I asked British Gas if I can pay someone privately to fix it as despite paying my monthly fee to have this sorted by British Gas, the main priority is to have hot water. They said they would not cover the costs and advised me to use a kettle instead for hot water. When the manager I complained to then messes you around and doesn't bother calling back with an update you know something is seriously wrong. I have a job so I have to take time out to be home available and it is super frustrating after the 6-hour time slot has ended that they call me to say they can't make it. I have lost out financially by not being at work, paying a monthly fee for nothing and still no fix or idea of when someone will come. Oh yeh and for this eventual fix, I have to pay a ¬£60 excess fee on top of the monthly fee which is a complete joke!

Stay away from British Gas. Terrible company. Terrible engineers. Terrible managers.

I am with Homecare agreement which has home appliance covered. my Micowave breaks down and report it on the 26th November to get an earliest appointment for 6th December this 11 days later. They called to cancel the appointment on the 3rd and offered me an appointment forthe 14th December.  I conplaint that this is not good enough compaint was not logged.  I called on  6th to see why no one called for my compaint. Fillany spoke to them on 12th they offered ¬£30 as agood will gesture then again today 14th no one turned up.  I have mad another compaint as the appoinment is for the 28th December.  I have not had my ¬£30 or anyone who has looked at my microwave.  I would give British Gas zero stars and would stay a way from their applicance policies as they take your premiums but have not one to do the work.

Tried to make an appointment to get my Nu Flame Slimline Radiant HE (6 yrs old) gas fire repaired. First two appointments not attended - actually cancelled without notification from B Gas. 
Engineer turned up on the third appointment spent a lot of time looking on his computer and about 30 seconds looking at the fire. He then announced that my gas fire was not on his approved list and he could not have not do any repair work on the fire.
Thanks British Gas, a waste of around 3 days of my time.  You were given full details of my gas fire and it‚Äôs problem when I made the appointment. The radiant HE is a popular brand and I rang Nu Flame 
who confirmed you carry out repairs on their fires.
I would give you no stars if it was allowed.

Absolute liars! Missed appointment after a phone call that the engineer is going to be late.I called them the next day to be told that the engineer visited at 7:21 but no one answered when I confronted the gentleman the line got disconnected magically so I called again to be told the same story and offering an appointment almost two months later; which I refused and insisted on filling a complaint. The story however re the engineer changed to ""the engineer was new to area and hence could not find the address.They offered a ¬£30 compensation but I wanted to progress a complaint to save others from these liars, I was on the phone for over 50 minutes and around 10 minutes for the complaints team only to be told that they will call me in two days and after insisting I have a complaint number which might not be real. Definite liars. Looks like this a common practice in British. I am sure no one will call me. Let's see....

We have been paying Bg for an annual Homecare agreement for a number of years. Last month we were away when our boiler developed a fault.  This was discovered by our son who immediately contacted me.  I then tried to arrange a call our under the Homecare agreement. The fault was discovered on Friday night I rang BG from New Zealand where we were at the time. Two attempts were made to arrange a visit  each were both through an automated system that was unable to comprehend my information and which cut me off. I eventually got through to a human being only to be told that the first available slot was the following Monday between 12 and 6pm. to facilitate the appointment my son had to take a day off work with loss of earnings. On the day of the appointment the engineer finally arrived at 4.45pm which meant that my son did not really have to take a day off work and could easily have worked round the attendance problem. The engineer then inferred that the boiler had not been serviced recently [despite a service being supposedly conducted within the last three months by themselves. He also stated that the problem related to the motherboard which needed replacing but could not be done that day as he did not have one with him. An further appointment was made for the following day this time the engineer agreed to ring when he was on his way so that my son did not have to take a further day off work. When the engineer eventually arrived at gone 5pm the repair was carried out bu the system still failed to work. it was then decided the fault laid with the pump, which was replaced.
When we returned home a week later we found that the heating system failed again. I contacted BG, but they could only send an engineer the following day between 8 and 1.00. The recommendation from BG was to put on more layers of clothes!  The engineer arrived around 11am and so called fixed the problem which he though was to do with fan. The boiler keeps cutting out and the pressure drops. It has to be restarted manually. 
By now we had decided to get a new boiler but was assured that the boiler should last until the replacement has been made. That was Friday, when we got up on Saturday we found that the boiler had cut out again. I tried to arrange another visit only to find the the first available one was the following Monday. I did however managed to restart the boiler and had done so on a further five occasions. We have constantly check to ensure the boiler is still working and the pressure has been maintained.
As a result of all the hassle we are now considering not renewing our annual contract. Through my dealings with BG it is increasingly obvious that they are increasingly putting shareholders before customers. There are not enough engineers to cover their services.  Engineers appear to resolve the issues on the surface and do not delve into the causes.

We moved home and made the mistake of get involved with British Gas. Two months on they dare still sending all correspondence to the old address. After two months of trying to chayour home address we have given up and decided to move to a different provider. British Gas lies and inefficiency sets new standards for poor customer Service. Avoid at all costs.

I booked an appointment ten days in advance for boiler service and radiator repair.  The timeslot was 12 midday to 6pm.  I  booked the day off work as I work 20 miles away.  At 5.40pm, the call center rang and told me that the appointment was cancelled as the engineer was stuck on a leak somewhere.  The excuse for calling me at 5.40 was that the agent had to call other customers first.  This kind of service stinks.  I'll be cancelling my account and using a more reliable and honest company.

Only 1 because I can't give a 0 rating.
Been paying for a care package for years for our boiler. Our service was postponed due to other emergencies earlier this year yet when our boiler breaks down leaving us with no hot water or heating (effectively living in a fridge) we're refused an emergency call out because our daughter is over 1!
She's 2... 
In any normal civilised world leaving a preschooler in a house for 36+ hours with no heating or hot water is scandalous.
If BG we're our energy supplier...this would be different.. we could sign up and they'd come out because she's under 5!!!
We still pay you money every month British Gas and this is what we get? 
I am beyond furious. Why is my child worth less than another's who's family get their energy from you?? 
Once this shambles is dealt with we will be going elsewhere and I will be telling all and sundry how you sort your priorities

It is very hard to get through and you are passed from pillar to post.
They don't have the number of electricians needed to offer that service. Engineers fail to turn up/ fail to attend with the right parts and then never come back.
We had 5 failed appointments and are now getting a local electrician. 
Even the core boiler service is pretty useless. If there is a problem in winter- they say they are so busy that can't come urgently unless you are very old and frail or have a baby.

quite possibly the worst customer experience & service I have come across. First they send me an incorrect bill. To get it resolved I have to launch a complaint, which they say they will resolve in 7 days. hahaha! I then receive emails, txts from Debt recovery companies chasing the bill. I have explained the bill was in dispute, but they take no notice. Finally after 3 or 4 phone calls from me to customer services I reach somebody who cares. They call me back and say they have resolved the problem and confirm there was an overcharge (over ¬£1000) I am offered a ¬£20 goodwill gesture of my bill for the inconvenience, which I accept and pay the bill over the phone. They also agree to call off the debt recovery company. I request new invoices. When I check the invoice they do not add up to what I paid. I also notice that the charge for Gas looks really expensive as no appliances are running as the property was empty. Can a pilot light on a boiler cost ¬£2 per day? I don't think so. I have to call customer services again! grrrr. Upon getting through I am told that the reason the bills don't add up is because I was charged a ¬£25 late payment fee. What a liberty and so much for the ¬£20 goodwill gesture. Now Im fuming! I ask if they can check the gas usage. They respond by saying ""Mr Hixon are you saying the meter is faulty because if its not there will be a ¬£400 charge for the engineer visit. Another liberty!!!! I request a call back from a manager. No surprise I""m still waiting and I'm not holding my breath. Oh and today I got a letter from the debt recovery company which just about tops it off.....

I have given this rating in relation to the poor customer service I have experienced and the high cost of their cover plans. They have been inconsistent with their polices and my entitlements for the cover I have taken out with them. For three years I had been paying for central heating and radiator cover but was told by the engineer who serviced my boiler that I wasn't covered.  I have also had a v frustrating time speaking to their customer service team who do not seem to be in agreement about their data protection policies.  Although my partner added my name to the account, and it was confirmed to me that I would have full access, whenever I spoke to a different member of staff I was told something different.

My central heating boiler is old, doesn't cost a lot to run and has worked perfectly since my wife and I bought our house (in Grantham 23 months ago). That is until it was serviced in April, for the second time, by British Gas. The engineer remarked at how clean it was and how quietly it ran. However, a few days later the pilot light went out. Although it relit easily the problem persisted sometimes going out after a few days or more. I requested a repair and,in May, a new thermocouple was fitted and I was asked to monitor performance. The problem came and went at irregular intervals, the biggest being 29 days, so I requested another appointment and this was arranged for August 6th. The first thing the ""engineer"" did on arrival was to tell me that ""hot gases"" from the boiler flue were ""scorching"" the wood of an adjacent storm porch. This was despite the fact that paint was flaking off on both sides of the porch because redecoration was required, nothing to do with ""hot gases"". He then diagnosed the problem as a faulty gas valve but told me that parts are not available. Not true since they are available from several suppliers but BG doesn't keep them. He then proceeded to fit another new thermocouple and an overheat stat, all the while telling me I need a new boiler and asking me to arrange an appointment to get a quote from BG which I did to shut him up because he went on about it for so long. I was saved the trouble of cancelling subsequently since the sales rep. was off sick and couldn't attend! Before leaving he told me my boiler is a fire risk and should be turned off. I declined. When he had gone I saw that he had left a ""do not use"" card in the boiler. I then called in an independent gas safe registered engineer who confirmed there was no problem with ""hot gases"" and that gas valves are available if required. From this experience I can only assume that the ""engineer"" is in some kind of commission scheme for generating appointments and selling new boilers. Today I received an email to tell me my Homecare agreement will renew shortly with a telephone number to call with any query. Why would I want to renew if parts are not available? I called it and was faced with an automated system that asked me to say my reason for calling then told me it didn't recognise that reason! Apparently ""cancel"" is not in its vocabulary. You have to say ""Homecare"" then answer ""yes"" when the system asks you if it's about a renewal. After 10 minutes I got through to someone and explained the reason for my call. She asked me to hang on. A few minutes later she told me that I needed to speak to the cancellation department but there was a long queue which I could either join or have a call back from BG. I opted for the latter and was told it could take up to 48 hours!! I asked why I had to speak to someone else and was told she was not authorised to take cancellations. I remember when British Gas was easy to deal with and gave good service. What happened?

The property had a prepaid meter installed so whilst we were doing the up we kept the prepaid meter going, topping up at the Post Office as we went along.  British Gas keep sending us the same bill for 'paying monthly', I have phoned them 5 times now to explain we have a prepaid meter, every time they check and after about 1/2 an hour they say 'yes you are correct we will credit the bill'.  Every month I get the same bill again, go through the whole process.  Today I received a bill where they have added a charge to my account.

My mum had a new boiler installed, a big job because it was moved to a new location in the house. This cost the best part of 10k I believe. We just had a plumber round to fit a new kitchen tap and he discovered the hot water tank was leaking around a pipe. He said it was never installed properly only ""hand tightened"". My mum is elderly with dementia so she struggles to keep on top of things, therefore she didn't alert us to the small damp patch on the kitchen ceiling where the pipe upstairs had been dripping. I called British Gas about this, only to find out that she was 17 days beyond her warranty and they would not come to rectify it unless we pay. I fully understand the need for a cut off period on a warranty, but this issue had clearly been going on for more than 17 days and was a poor/faulty installation issue, rather than a boiler breakdown.

When they closed the account, they sent me a final bill:
- Gas usage was 4x what I had actually used 
- They moved me to another tariff which has a standing charge that was 50% higher than all the bills that were being sent to the ""The Occupier"" at the address.

Try moving house to see just how useless British Gas can be. All I wanted was to transfer my account from one house to another which was no hassle with any other utility provider ..... but British Gas is in a league of its own for being absolutely useless.
Started by going on their moving house web page which didn't work so after a struggle managed to phone and was immediately transferred to another dept who took all the details of my old address and my new address .... Simple you might think !!! 
It all started to fall apart from then on, phone calls, texts, messages on my online account page and still not working and now I see I have two accounts running and they are still asking for meter readings which have been provide 6 times and still I await a resolution.
If I had known the hassle I would experience I would have simply gone straight to another provider ..... in fact when I finally get sorted out I will do just that.

He had to come back the following day so instead of the quick service he spent 4 hours going over my boiler and putting everything right.

I am now looking for a competitor

A customer of BG for over 20 years, I changed supplier to the Peoples Energy Company because of the continual poor customer service and continuing price rises. My big gripe with them is the speed with which they send final bills to debt collection agencies. I contacted them to arrange a payment plan for the final bills. They were happy to take a payment and then informed me that they couldn't set up a payment plan because the final bills were in the process of being handed over to a debt collection agency. This was less than ONE MONTH after receiving the final bill. They refused to cancel the DCA but still took the money out of my account. Bloody awful service from someone willing to pay a debt. NEVER USE BRITISH GAS

Absolutely awful service. Very rude staff being aggressive towards me. When I complained to a supervisor, they told me they would transfer me to the correct department then just put me back in a queue. I was on the phone to them for 30 minutes and they didn't resolve my simple query. Shocking company. I will be cancelling my homecare cover at renewal.

Awful! I moved into a flat recently and found the electric meter had been bypassed. Being the honest chap i am i rung British Gas to tell them. Within an hour i got a callback to meet them at the property and they will fix it and install a new meter. I went to the flat and 3 hours late a big burley man turns up and asks to look at the meter which i showed him. He then advised me he didn't know what he was looking at and needed an engineer. A couple of uncomfortable hours with the burley bloke and an engineer turns up. He then disconnected everything, took the meter didn't install another and left me with no electricity. I then found out the burley bloke was security for the engineer. British gas are a joke, if you ever find yourself in the same situation i recommend rinsing them for as much as you can....

I am only giving 1 star but they don't deserve any.  I moved to the West Country in October 2016, and as I had Homecare at my last home in London, I immediately signed up with my new house and got a service in November 2016, which was good, or at least I thought it was, the service engineer said I needed a new filter and said a quote would be sent, which it was but about 3 weeks later.  I tried to ring British Gas to get an engineer to fit the filter, but got no response.  I contacted a local plumber and he replaced the filter for a quarter of the price British Gas were quoting, so I was enough, a lucky escape really.  When the following October came I kept looking at my online account and it kept saying 'you are not due for a service yet, we will notify you when you are'.  In November it was still saying this, so I rang up, they said they had no engineer until January, so 15 months after my last service, I took a days annual leave and the working day before, they rang up and cancelled! I made another appointment for the 9th April, again took 1 days annual leave, waited in all day until I eventually looked at the site at 6.30 and saw they had put 'book an engineer', during the day this was schedule for that day and changed at the end, no phone call, nothing, I then immediately put in a complaint and they said they would respond with 8 weeks!  It has now gone well past that 8 weeks and I have heard nothing.  Since my last service I have paid over ¬£400 to British gas, has lost 2 days annual leave and am now about to go to the ombudsman.  My nice local plumber has offered to service the boiler ¬£74, which I will take him up on. If I was paying him ¬£20 per month and he didn't deliver a service everyone would consider that outrageous and he would probably be done for fraud!  Why does British Gas think they are beyond the general rules of customer service?  Every part of their establishment has let me down.  Has anyone else out there reading this had the same problems?

They have lied, the customer service never do what they say, then they charge you for the privilege. They charged for a meter on a house my son had moved out of!! Apparently they broke into the new owners house and changed his meters when he was in hospital, the house was completely empty as we had told them he had moved out!!. Absolute joke. They had not recorded the previous conversations and then split the bills into two accounts to justify breaking in after the event. They never would have got a warrant for ¬£200 bill, so they split the bills and put a ¬£500 payment against the electric bill. Do not trust them and do not trust them to do as they say they will. They really do not care about their customers at all. When I asked what the final meter reading was, for the meter they changed they said they could not tell me, I said how can I agree the bill?  I would suggest you do not use them and do not trust them if you are currently with them!

Well British Gas is simply a terrible company to deal with.  British gas wrote my boiler off, even though it had been serviced just 3 weeks earlier saying the galvanised metal has rusted within the boiler!! We therefore had no heating or hot water.  British Gas promised to install our new boiler (a top of the range Worcester) and zone our house to allow each floor to be individually controlled with a hive!  After installing the boiler they refusing to complete the job.  Please be aware that they lie bout what they offer!
I would award 0 start if available.  Please avoid, they are not cheap and their after sales service is terrible!

At one point they stated I was due ¬£90 to be returned to me which would be paid within 30 days, then I get a threatening email stating I am due them ¬£22 and it would doubled and passed to debt collectors if I did not pay it right away.

We didn't live at our old address for 6 years (we sold our house in Feb 2012) but every month British gas still charges us 7 pounds per month. I have been contacted with home care British gas following the number 08002949650. They asked me to call 08002948320. Then when I called 08002948320, they then asked me to call 08002949650. No one can be able to cancel the direct debit and refund my money for the last 6 years. I have been calling none stop but no one can sort it out. There were 4 conversations someone even turned off the line. I asked them for the email address so that I can send the copy of my bank account to prove the amount charging every month as it showed clearly that British gas but they couldn't give me the email address. Tonight I called them again and they said that someone will call me back on Wednesday. I told them that I will be busy at my office so can they send me via, or give me an email address so that I can write my queries but they said that they can't. Anyway hopefully someone from British gas will call me on Wednesday

My mum is 84 lives alone, has mobility problems, and dementia. She is supposed to be on the priority register. In the bad weather in early March the boiler broke. I started ringing at 12mid day and was told someone would be out by 6pm. At 2ish I was struggling to keep mum warm. Following numerous phone calls, being put on hold or being hung up on at 7.30 pm I was told nobody would come as everyone had been sent home! I managed to get a lovely local gas engineer who came within 30 minuets and fixed the boiler.
I complained that night via email to BG, on the Thursday morning my brother informed me a BG engineer had left a sorry we missed you card at mums at 00.51 in the morning. This is a vulnerable person with dementia, what planet do BG live on. Of course she wouldn‚Äôt open the door at that time in the morning.A few days later I complained directly to the CEO. Nothing from any of them. I complained a week later on the phone and was asked to send my email complaints to them again on 3 attempts they have been returned because they have been queuing for to long! I have had no response what so ever. It is absolutely deplorable. They deserve to go bust. I‚Äôm in the process of moving mum from BG.

In response to the previous message, do not pay British Gas, go to the Financial Ombudsman.  I had to do that as they owed me a refund and had no intention of paying it.  I would advise anyone who is thinking of doing business with British Gas not to.  They will take your money and not fulfil their commitment to you.  You will find out very quickly that depending on your age you are not a priority customer and if you look further into the reviews and on other review pages ie Facebook you can see that priority customers don't really mean anything to them, they will leave you without heating or hot water no matter what your age.   I had two services booked with them, both were cancelled one on the afternoon of the service.  Have received two cheques as a good will gesture one for ¬£5.40 and another for ¬£30,  I think they were hoping I would give up fighting for the ¬£100 they owed me.  I have now after spending approx 5 hours on the phone speaking to the most incompetent staff I have ever encountered.  received a full refund, but as I mentioned earlier this is because the financial ombudsman was now involved. 
So to anyone reading this review please do not give British Gas your money, they are not a reputable company.  Living on the longevity of their name, certainly no longer on their service.

The worst customer service I have ever experienced. We have customer Homecare and they are threatening to pass owed money to debt collector. They have charged us twice for one job. We have tried numerous times to get through on the phone and online customer services obviously do nothing. I am now in a 30 minute queue to pay this amount as the stress is really not helping my husbands blood pressure. We have basically been bullied into paying money we do not owe.
Also, when we registered there was an offer of a voucher and this was never received. They have not replied to this query either.
I am still in the queue to pay money I do not owe. I will be cancelling my contract but I am dreading trying to speak to someone.

Been with BT home care for over 10 years but in my opinion the service is getting worse by the year. All they are interested in is getting extra money out of clients, they do not seem to answer written complaints.  Wrote to them in December complaining about a charge for a new tap replaced in my kitchen.....no answer. About 2 years ago I had trouble with my boiler, they told me it was the slush in the system and that they would not repair the boiler without having the system flushed, paid BG ¬£700   to have it flushed, ended up having to replace the boiler. Not to mention when they replaced my boiler, it was a complete nightmare, very unprofessional fitters. Now my contract with BG is at an end.....Thank God. I will look for a more professional company

British Gas Homecare are disorganised, dreadful and totally unreliable.  After having homecare cover for over 20 years we decided to replace our central heating boiler.   Before arranging for our plumber to install the new boiler we contacted British Gas and confirmed that the new boiler could transfer to our current homecare contract ‚Äì confirmed the make and model.  After installation we provided the make, model and serial number and British Gas continued to cover our new boiler.  After the first year British Gas completed the first service.  On the second year we booked the service and the British Gas Engineer refused to service the boiler informing us that our boiler wasn‚Äôt service listed with British Gas and left without carrying out the boiler service and confirming that the area Service Manager would be in contact.  No contact was made so I telephoned the British Gas Homecare contact centre to try and confirm the situation.  One call centre agent confirmed the boiler was service listed and another said it wasn‚Äôt and British Gas would have to refund the contract payments for the last two years ‚Äì not a very satisfactory response!
We raised a complaint with British Gas customer service who agreed to send out an engineer to investigate why the boiler isn‚Äôt service listed.  On the day of the visit British Gas cancelled due the recent bad weather conditions with one-hour notice ‚Äì not very helpful after making several complaints and telephone calls.  We now have a call booked but must wait a further two weeks for the engineer to check and confirm why British Gas have issues servicing our Glow-worm 774 boiler.  We have contacted the manufacturer who has confirmed that they don‚Äôt have any known service issues with the Glow-worm 774 boiler and can‚Äôt understand why are facing issues getting British Gas to cover the boiler.

Left British gas 2nd february to join  smaller energy supplier bulb who are fantastic. I was told i would receive my final bill within 6 weeks but it arrived within 2 days .Paid over the internet but found out they took the payment twice. Rang them up over 4 weeks ago about this and they said they would send cheque out within 5-10 days . Did not arrive so have rang them back  numerous times only to find out on the first occasion it had not been sent and now they are putting the blame on royal mail. Funny how when you owe them money they want it next day but when we are owed it it takes forever. Customer service is shocking. Do not seem to know what they are talking about .  Also my bills were going to double but thanks to bulb I will be saving over ¬£500  a year. These big firms have exploited us for years . My advice  have a look at smaller suppliers especially bulb.

We have a British Gas Homecare contract covering the boiler for over 6 years. In that time we've had only positive experiences with both the telephone staff & also engineers. Parts that have been replaced are diverter & also isolation valves, pump & circut board. Only once did they cancel but they let me know. I'm paying little over ¬£5.00 per week & that includes a ¬£90.00 yearly service. Couple of weeks before renewal i ring them & politely haggle to get something off the new premium. Regards non Brit Gas engineers i know there are decent ones out there but in our experience we don't want the hassle of having to keep chasing them & also attempting to rip us off.

Our boiler started acting up in November, we set up with Homecare with britishgas and booked inn a boiler check up for February 6th (earliest they had!)
6th came and went, no one showed up, we tried to get ahold of their customer service, after several calls where we sat over 30 mins at a time on hold, we got nowhere.
Of course, today our boiler breaks down, Im trying to get ahold of Homecare and I am currently at 50 mins on hold ! Earliest i could book online was for the 5th...so we'll see now if they show up...

If you're considering this company, don't bother. I will cancel my homecare and change to another company, even if they cost more, because this has been a total waste of money.

My 84 year old mother has struggled with a very poor British Gas Homecare service for over 2 years. This last 12 months mum has been paying ¬£45 a month. During that time she has survived advanced cancer, and sepsis, having to be resusitated more than once. 
The heating and water have continuously played up, sometimes not working at all for several days. The service had no continuity and the answering service a nightmare for elderly people, taking several minutes to get through if it can be accessed at all. 
British Gas fitted the boiler, magnetic filter system and did a power flush 6 years ago, costing over 3 thousand pounds, and mum had no trouble for 3 and a half years.
The engineers, when they didn't cancel, would go away promising to return in a few days which usually turned into weeks. In the last 2 and a ahalf years mum has had several engineers all trying different things, only to have the system fail again a few days later. There was no consistancy or reliability and there fore they are not recommended by us. 
This has been very stressful for mum and after everything she has been through this service has just made her very upset...therefore today she has cancelled her direct debit as they had put her monthly bill up for the next twqelve months by ¬£10 to ¬£55 a month. What an awful way to treat older people.....

Very bad homecare boiler service

Very bad homecare boiler service. Had appointment in December 2017 for annual service which got cancelled an hour prior to appointment using the excuse of engineers being re directed to emergency call outs, which initially I had some sympathy with. Then came the annoying part, next available slot 23rd February 2018. I called the complaint line and was offered ¬£30 compensation and a 2 hour time slot for next appointment on 23rd February. I asked why the boiler had not been serviced since September 2016 and was told reminders no longer sent out, and as long as they did a service anytime during the contract year that was acceptable. Also note that no compensation was offered by the initial caller cancelling the original appointment. Fast forward to 23rd Feb, and I get a call in the morning cancelling the appointment for same reasons and before, no compensation offered, just another date in April. Call the complaint line, get another ¬£30 and a new 2 hour slot appointment for 19th April. This will mean I will have only got 3 services in 4 years, it goes without saying I wont be renewing.

Update on my review of 2 months ago. My December service visit for my boiler (which had never occurred within the timeframe of my home care agreement) was cancelled due to too many emergency call outs for Engineers, was again cancelled today Feb 12th, 10 minutes before the end of the 4 hour slot. Next slot available APRIL !!! 
Also received a letter to say that my complaint raised back in December was still under investigation.
What an appalling level of customer service. 
I think my name has a marker against it following the cancellation of my policy & they are trying to grind me down by continually cancelling my service visit & not investigating my compliant within a reasonable period of time.

It killed me to give a one star rating as they are not worthy of it! When we moved into our new home, our gas & electricity supply was already set up with British Gas. We had constant issues with our gas & electricity meter reading when we were trying to close our account. There call handlers don't know what they are doing, the whole company needs scrapping, sending us several final bills all for different amounts, absolute ridiculous. Anybody thinking of using British Gas, I advise you to stay well away as they are useless and will rip you off!

I would like to give a no star rating but that option is not available here. I had gas and electricity supply with British Gas. Had lots of issues with gas meter reading as there system somehow reverse the readings at times and I used to get a number of phone calls asking to pay extra ¬£1000 in addition to the monthly direct debit of ¬£52 for a two bedroom flat. Hence changed the service provider in October 2017 and I was told I‚Äôm due for a refund of ¬£750. In December I got a cheque from British Gas for ¬£1280. Two weeks later I got another letter from them saying I need to pay ¬£1337 to close my account. I have disputed the bill. Their call handlers and complaints team repeatedly said I need to pay ¬£1337 to close the account. It took nearly two months for them to finally accept that I was due for a refund and I need to pay only ¬£870 back after clearing the cheque they send me. Meanwhile I was getting repeated calls and emails from their debt recovery service saying I need to pay ¬£1350. Stay away from British Gas if possible. Worst service ever experienced.

Arranged an appointment (under HomeCare cover) for a technician to repair my boiler the next day. Would have been good service but they never turned up. Rearranged then for the Monday am (no heat/water for 3 days by then) for which they did not turn up (no call) and then pm which they also did not turn up for (no call). Each time I've had to chase British Gas to find out what was going on. No appointment for Monday, best they then offered was Thursday, so six days without heating/water before they even turn up.
It's still Monday, and it's still cold. By Thursday, it's supposed to get colder...

I too have a British Gas Homecare cover, paying ¬£19.77 per month.  I moved to the West country from London, and had the Boiler covered in London, when I moved in October 2016, they came and serviced the boiler in November and all was OK, although I did have a filter on the boiler, they quoted for a replacement and when I tried to book, couldn't get through, so left it and got a local plumber to do it for half the quoted price.  I registered on-line, and all was well, checked my online account about September, then October, then November as it was telling me my service wasn't due yet, and they would contact me.  Well I rang them, they said they were too busy at the moment but made an appointment for  January 22nd which was a Monday.  I organised myself to have a day off and on the Friday before that British Gas rang to say they are too busy to do the service and made another appointment for April!  When is an Annual Service not an Annual Service?  When British Gas are doing it, it becomes 18 months, although I have no confidence in the April date being maintained to the extent that I believe it is a ploy, they give you a date knowing full well it won't be stuck to.  Alongside all this, I am constantly seeing adverts for the Homecare package, so again these new unsuspecting customers will be taking up the time slots allocated to current customers.  The longer it takes to service my boiler, if I ever get it serviced, the more likely it is that it will break down, just like my car, if I paid a garage a regular amount each month in the promise that I would be serviced every year, and they didn't fulfil that promise, my car would probably break down completely.   I complained through the customer services complaints site in November and got no response whatsoever, I complained again last week and don't expect a response, where can I go to now?  Is there a Ombudsman?  All the time I am paying money, need the boiler serviced as it must now be inefficient and feel I am contributing to the high marketing cost of the adverts attempting to lure new customers in.

I have breakdown cover for my boiler. Called them on Monday 15.1 around 4pm as I had a problem with my boiler and the earliest they could send an engineer was Friday 19.1! Wasn't pleased especially when I found out that my cover had automatically been renewed at an increased price, with the first monthly amount having already been collected without my being informed.  Come Friday lunch time, phone went and expecting it to be engineer calling to advise he was on the way, I was appalled to find it was girl from call centre to advise engineer would not be calling due to high demand! Next earliest time they could come is Tuesday 23.1. Just not acceptable. Insultingly I was offered ¬£30 compensation which I could buy a heater with. I couldn't even speak to a manger/supervisor, they would get one to call me in 48hours!  I will be cancelling my contract ASAP

If possible I would give British Gas a ""no star rating"". I had a Combi boiler installed in January 2015. During the first year I called out an engineer twice as the water was not remaining hot when running a bath. This problem was never solved. The first service (understood to be free) in Feb 2016, again, did not solve the bath water problem. I called out an engineer again and once more the problem was not fixed. I got in touch with Bosch, the manufacturer, who sent out an engineer and the fault was rectified. He also told me there was a leak on a radiator which was causing a pressure drop. This radiator was replaced and the system now works fine. 
I was also informed by British Gas, on the first service, that  ""a not to current standards"" situation was on my appliance but that it was safe. This would involve an upgrade payment which I would not pay. The service was carried out in March 2017.
In2018 the service cost increased by 15.5%. When I complained about this they could not justify the large increase to me. Based on the first service being free and my direct debit starting straight afterwards, I assumed that my 2018 service (which has not taken place) was paid for only to be told by British Gas that the first service was when the boiler  was installed!!!

Needless to say I have cancelled my service agreement and no longer wish to be associated with this shambolic company. I still believe money is owed me and will pursue this.

For the third year running British Gas have failed to do the legally-required CP12 gas safety certificate inspection on my rental property.  Apparently if you book the annual service visit online the gas safety inspection is not included - it seems you have to make a call to get this added on.  But nowhere in the paperwork (I went paperless but now do not get anything via email or the online account either!) or on the website does it say anything about this ""requirement"".  So you pay for the inspection but it does not get done, and the company does not seem able to amend its website to either tell you this or add a box for ""safety inspection and certification required"".  The website states:
""Gas Safety Certificate - What's included
An inspection of your gas meter and pipework, carried out at the same time as your annual service.
A safety inspection of any additional gas appliances you have selected (charged per appliance).
A Gas Safety Certificate showing the outcome of the inspection and a reminder when it‚Äôs due for renewal.""

It also says in the full terms and conditions:
""Gas Safety Certificate (CP12)
This can only be purchased with a British Gas product that includes an annual service and will normally be completed at the same time as your annual service.""

The only reason that I have stayed a British Gas customer is because the engineers they employ in my area are really good.

Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I took out a Landlords Homecare policy and was due for an engineer to visit my property today as I have tenants moving in on Monday and I legally have to have a gas safety certificate before they can move in.  The engineer didn‚Äôt turn up and when I called then they said for some reason the engineer hadn‚Äôt been booked in properly and that the only thing they could do is re-book for March! I have tow tenants that now cannot move into my flat on Monday and are going to be homeless.

What a useless service, interested only in the bottom line.  My boiler service included in my Homecare 400 has been postponed every year for the last four years, putting them back approximately 2 months each time. A 14 month service for your 12 month fee.

British gas Homecare. Terrible, terrible service. Booked an appointment two months in advance at my parents' house. Drove 100 miles. No-one turned up. Called up, only to be told that it had been cancelled due to lots of boiler break-downs. There was no notice, no compensation, no recourse. I asked to escalate the issue, and was told it would take two months. Also, two months to get another appointment.

We had an electrical fault caused by the boiler this weekend.  It not only cut off the electricity and kept tripping the system but the boiler system was shorting out.  Within 6 hours, two seperate engineers (one electrical and one for the boiler) came to the house, despite British Gas own booking systems being upgraded and causing issues, and resolved the issue with brilliant efficiency.  The fault was not obvious but the care, attention, politeness and attitude of the engineers was superb and I cannot fault these guys.

British Gas have asked us for a ¬£90 security deposit stating that our credit score was not good enough. We have checked our credit score with Experian, the same company that British Gas use and our credit is very good to excellent. We rang and told them and they then said it was because of our past history with them! We told them that we had not been with them for over 30 years and even then there had been nothing wrong with our payments. They will not recognise that they are making a mistake - best to forget giving them our custom!,

We moved into a new property and after a few days the boiler started playing up. We had  British Gas Homecare so called them up and told them that the boiler wasn't working and the my girlfriend who has had heart surgery needs the heating to be on during this cold period. They sent an emergency engineer over that eventually turned up at 1am. he looked at the boiler and said that he had borrowed a van and didn't really have any tools. He then carried on texting on his phone and that was it. The next day (Saturday) another engineer arrived and spent the whole day fixing!?!?! the boiler. lovely guy but the next day the boiler was on the blink again. Called BG and they made another appointment for the following day. They didn't turn up or even call us. I called them and they said we have to reschedule, no sorry or anything. I told them I had someone sick at home so they said they would send an emergency guy over. By 11pm no one had turned up so I called and they told me that there were still three jobs ahead of me and that they would not fix anything only make the boiler safe. Needless to say no one came. I now have another appointment in two days time so let's see what happens.

I would not recommend BG to anyone, most of the guys they have working for them have such a heavy workload that they don't have the time to actually fix boilers and most of the time do not have the tools or the parts.

Total waste of time and money!!!

Horrible service. 
I have received letter from British gas for to book annual service. I had called British gas customer service and booked annual service on 3rd Aug. 2017. 
When engineer starts to the service, British gas engineer has been given over air pressure with pedal pump, then the small cylinder is blasted, I am witnessed for that. After that he hasn‚Äôt allowed anyone to watching him. Next day he has replaced with new one.
9th Aug.2017 I have received letter from British gas they are cancelled my home care agreement. Reason is showing, ‚Äúno longer meets Gas safety or Building Regulations‚Äù. Previous Boiler service history was showing, same company (British gas) was serviced on 9th Sept. 2016. 
Then I was send letter and previous service history to British gas complaint team on 24th October 2017 and asking refund, British gas deducted money from my account ¬£119.00.

2 of those are giving me problems,,, i already cancelled 3 because they truly do not provide a fair service

they refused to fix a boiler blaming sludge leaving at risk tenants with no hot water.
tried to charge me ¬£750 for a flush....a new boiler is ¬£650 to buy!
40 mins waiting on the phone each time i call
They cut you off the phone if they feel like it making you wait another 40 mins
they will put up the price about 25% every year unless you threaten to leave
Out of 6 policies 5 have given me numerous reasons to be VERY unhappy with them
If you think problems with your single policy are just unlucky....

Made an appointment to have my boiler serviced months ago. At the last minute British Gas cancelled the appointment offering a pre-winter service in March! I said this was not acceptable. British Gas phoned back on the actual day of the appointment offering me a service between 12 and 6 pm on Saturday afternoon. As I wanted a service and not risk a winter breakdown I accepted. Waited in all Saturday and, of course, nobody came, nobody phoned to say they wouldn't be coming, pathetic customer service by a company that knows it can lose over 800000 customers and simply rip off remaining customers with higher prices. Price caps are long overdue, force this company to improve efficiency and customer service.

I am a British gas customer, we were out of country for 45 days, when back smart meter was not working, the bill was doubled & I raised an enquiry. They took more than a month to respond and in the mean time they cancelled my direct debit without instructions. Sent an engineer to my house in my absence without my permission and did some work in smart meters when my husband at home.and he was unaware of the whole issue. And the whole dispute went for few months and in the mean time , never resolved. I told them I will switch the supplier and pay the bill. Before they  sent the bill I had to go out of country for an emergency.  I told them I will come and pay the bill in full and they said it us fine. I spoke to customer service at least 50 times for this issue. Multiple times they said I can pay the bill once it is resolved. They agreed they cancelled direct debit by mistake in an email. But now they say it was my request. I have an email. I came back from holiday and paid the full bill. Still they reported to credit agency 2 late payments on my account which is affecting my mortgage now. I tried to speak to them, 2 agents said it was not my mistake and they will get it removed in 10 days and I will get a call from British gas. No call till now and I called them this agent is so rude and she says I know BG cancelled DD but why didn't u check your account that money is not going you should have paid it. She is not trying to listen to me instead is blaming me for not paying the bill. Was trying g to explain her paying is not a problem but wanted an answer from BG. BG agents told me I can pay after coming back as the final bill was not settled.  They never advised me it will reflect as late payment. As there was an issue here I thought i can pay once the bill is settled. But this lady today is so rude and unacceptable. Now BG information has affected my credit rating. Today I decide not to be BG customer for life and advise my family on the same.  I don't mind paying even higher cost to other suppliers bit never BG in life. I was asking the lady how can BG decide things without consulting me about cancelling DD, sending engineer without pernission, writing on my acvount that i requested DD cancellation - she says they can do that as they are in that position. I had nothing to speak after this and I hung up. That means now after I hang up they can write whatever they want and how can we trust them. So never British Gas. BE Careful. This was so much stress for raising a query and switching the supplier. This is only bkackmark on my credit for 9 years if stay I  this country. Avoid it in every possible way

After some years as a home care customer, I decided that on receiving a renewal quote of over ¬£460 I would go elsewhere for my cover. On phoning to cancel my policy I was immediately offered an improved quote. Why wasn't I given this in the first instant ??
I had not had the included boiler service either within the term of the policy, this was scheduled for 2 days after my policy end date but I was informed it would still occur. Today I received a text cancelling my annual boiler service with a lame excuse that the Engineers were all very busy fixing broken down boilers. I would get a letter sometime to rebook.
Apparently BG have lost 850,000 customers this year. I became 850,001. They are never competitive on pricing, always amongst the most expensive & very poor service levels.

They claimed to have read my meter, and over read it by 10,000KWH and over charged me hundred of pounds.. it took around 6 weeks to resolve, hours on hold on numerous phone calls, around 11 more incorrect bills, to get my money back, which left me over drawn and unable to pay my other bills. When I asked them to cover my interest and costs, they offered me ¬£40 (nowhere near the costs their error has incurred me)... when I accepted and said I wanted to still complain to ofgem I was told they would retract their offer of compensation if I complained to ofgem.

I neded a replacement boiler fitted. My 30 year old boiler could not be repaired.
The BG advisor, Martin Johnson, called on Tuesday 14th November 2017.
Martin was helpful,gave honest advice,and was not pushy. I was aware that BG would
not be the cheapest but in my experience you get what you pay for. I agreed to go ahead.
Later the same evening I was called and told that the new boiler could be fitted the next day.
By 8am on 15th the new boiler and other parts had been delivered, and scaffolding was being put up.
The fitter,Steve Childs, turned up on time and started work. He was pleasant, worked hard and kept mess to a minimum.
Later the same day the BG electrician,David Skinner,anothervery pleasant chap, arrived to connect the electrical side of things.
The scaffolding was removed early the next day and the old boiler etc was collected.
Needless to say I was 100% happy with everything. In this day and age it is unusual to get service like this. Many thanks to all concerned.

I have only rated British Gas with 1 star because your site does not enable zero stars 

Their projected usage for me is a joke and not based on reality. I am a disabled pensioner with limited income and have been a loyal customer for over 40 years without a single missed payment, yet despite being nearly ¬£100 in credit at end of last review they wanted
an increase of around 25%, I refused and in May 2017 they increased my direct debit by 35% to ¬£74 per month without advising me and sending me overdrawn for the first time ever, requiring me to draw cash from a fixed-term bond with loss of bonus. I managed to get my monthly charge reduced to ¬£55 with dire warnings that I would be around ¬£300 in debt at the end of my term.

At the end of my current term I am nearly ¬£200 in credit, yet they insist upon a monthly payment of ¬£73 pounds or ¬£94 if I ask for my credit back !

When I call their ""Help Line"" I get a nice asian chap who's English is incomprehensible
who keeps repeating ""you must pay"".

I cannot wait to switch and advise all British Gas customers to do likewise.

Utterly disgusting customer service and standards.

British gas claimed to have read my meter and have over read it by 9000 Kwh. (I actually dont believe they did read it). They have in error taken all the money out of my bank account and send me overdrawn and unable to pay my bills. I have now given them the correct meter reading 4 times over the last month, phoned 4 times, been promised it would be resolved within 20 days, waited, it has not been, and now told it can take up to another 6 weeks. When I asked them to cover the interest on the hundreds of pounds I have lent them for free, for months on end, I was told they can't compensate me for that. When I explained I have spent hours trying to resolve this unpaid, I was told they can't compensate me for that. All with an antagonising friendly customer friendly tone. I will never ever ever use these clowns again, and when I told them I would post bad reviews online, again they are not bothered. I was told 'I can do what I want'.

I have contacted the Mirror newspaper, who have run an article on this all too common error, and I will be making an official complaint to Ofgem.

BE WARNED DO NOT TRUST BRITISH GAS WITH A DIRECT DEBIT ON YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.  THEY HAVE SENT ME OVERDRAWN AND WITH NO MONEY DUE TO AN ERROR ON THEIR BEHALF. THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE DAMAGED MY CREDIT RATING.

I had booked an appointment to have a quote for a new central heating gas boiler to be fitted. On the due date, I received an email confirming that I could expect the BG Heating Adviser to arrive between 1pm and 3pm.
Because of this appointment, my wife had put off a visit from a close friend and her child who wanted to visit before the end of the school half-term holiday. Come 3pm and no sign of or contact from BG.
By 4pm, I had had enough and called BG to find out what was going on.
Whilst not being impolite, the person to whom I spoke was not particularly helpful and suggested that the engineer could have been held up in traffic; when I asked why he could not 'phone to let us know that there would be a delay she replied that drivers are not allowed to make calls whilst driving. My obvious response to this was that perhaps he should stop, put the brake on and turn off the ignition before calling!
The call ended when I said that I would cancel the visit altogether and look for another installer.
I then decided to call the customer complaints number. I explained the situation and after much hoo-hah, was told that a complaint would be ""raised"" on my behalf. I then asked to whom I could write at the highest level in the organisation to further my complaint and was advised that I would be passed on to a relevant department. After quite a long delay somebody came on the line and I once again explained my complaint. He told me that he had no idea why I had been passed to his department! My response was "" British Gas organisation is a joke!"" By now I was past anger and was becoming amused because if you don't laugh you'll cry. I have been a loyal customer of BG for many years and have avoided advice to ""switch"" even though I knew I might save money.
This experience has now made the decision for me - goodbye to British Gas!

Used the wrong address for electricity at the beginning of the contract , took months to put right, didn‚Äôt seem to use my actual meter readings for electricity or keep track of payments , now at the end of the contract they sent me a bill overcharging  me for electricity , it was amended after disputing it but no explanation why this happened, and  using a date that was before they took over from old supplier.the final payment still excessive and clearly wrong give me 7 days, won‚Äôt let me access info on online account and who has hours to spend on the phone keep going over the same thing , no confidence that they are using the right information and what they are charging is correct. I will never use British Gas again they don‚Äôt care and overcharge as if their right. The CEO should look at the comments on this site and hang their head in shame.

We moved into a new property and British gas charged us alot more than the meter reading read. So they threatened us with legal action if we did not pay. Just finished the phone call, The customer service lady said we had cancelled the complaint when we had not,  and told us you have to pay the amount. Not very nice phone call for anyone to experience. Will keep well clear of BRITISH GAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We have been with British Gas HomeCare for some years. Last Saturday we realised the central heating hadn't come on and my husband phoned to ask for an engineer and he said that he thought it was the thermostat.  The bored sounding call centre person told him that nobody could come until Wednesday morning.  We thought this was excessive as we pay every month and so I emailed them and told them my husband is 82 years old and I hoped they could come quicker than Wednesday.  I have not had a reply to my email only an automated email saying they would be in touch within 72 hours - they were not.
The engineer called this morning (Wednesday) and was very surprised that he had not been called in sooner.  He was quick and efficient and my husband had been right about the thermostat.  
We are now looking to take our business elsewhere.  British Gas has let us down in the past but the engineers who come are usually great.  Maybe BG should get rid of the Call Centre staff and provide people who can actually help the public and organize things properly.

I wanted a quote for Homecare cover( Boiler, plumbing an drains)  for renting out my property. I initially applied online and then did not finish my application because I ran out of time. British Gas subsequently phoned me to say they had noticed that I had not finished my application and could they help?. They were obviously keen for my custom- unlike some others who had not bothered to phone back -  and I ended up getting an excellent policy with them which suits my needs perfectly.

I persisted and was told british gas had done nothing wrong when they set up the direct debit as they don‚Äôt have to verify it is correct.

Worst incompetent service I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.

1. Signed up with British Gas, gave them meter serial numbers.
2. Account got opened with neighbors meters assigned to it anyway.
3. Neighbors changed energy suppliers, somehow that screwed up my account.
4. British Gas fixed that by creating another elecricity account for my flat. I now had two accounts, and didn't know that.
5. Meter readings were all wrong, and the ones I gave them kept being rejected. Billing was arbitrary.
6. Meter reading by meter inspector got rejected as well. Billing completely arbitrary.
7. I lost hope of getting this mess fixed, decided to leave.
8. Finally my gas meter readings got accepted, got billed correctly for the gas used on final bill.
9. Got billed arbitrary (but not excessive) amount for electricity as meter readings were still wrong which I paid just to get out.
10. Whoops, the second electricity account that was opened for my property (see 4) wasn't settled. British Gas double billed me and contacted by debt collectors without talking to me first.
11. Sorted this with British Gas, they admitted it was a mistake, promised to sort it out.
12. Got contacted again by debt collectors, as debt is still oustanding, almost ended up in court.
13. Countless hours on the phone, saga still continues... Worst incompetent service I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.

Had an estimated bill produced which i knew was wrong as my boiler was broken when moved into new house.. moved supplier as heard dire things about BG customer service,,, was happy to pay an accurate bill but BG will not wait... made numerous calls to sort it out and was told that they would stop the calls and letters until an accurate bill was produced.. next thing is a debt collection agency calling...more aggro and affecting my credit rating! the overseas call center girl said the rules are the rules.. are your rules wrong BG? They don't listen to reason and do not care.
i paid my bill with an extra 20pounds charge for my trouble... i asked the girl if she thought i would ever switch back to British gas.. no she said.. too right i said.. i asked who would get back to me about the complaint... she said the complaint is closed.. but i don't want it closed i said.. its closed for us she said... they have lied to me during numerous phone calls and the complaints process is a joke..

Horrendous experience with British Gas

Switched electricity account to British Gas in April 17 and paid three months by direct debit totalling ¬£157.50. In Jul 17, I discovered British Gas took over my neighbour's metre by error and I had to pay my previous electricity supplier for the three months. Called in July 3 times and emailed 3 times with no resolution in sight. Just received a letter stating my account balance is on ¬£67! The amount of errors in one account is staggering.

I had such a bad experience with this company its shocking . I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and the place used to be the office . British gas had not done a reading there for about 2 years but managed to send us a bill for 4 months for 2500¬£ !!!!!!!!! Next minute after a complain they changed it and we got a bill for 960!!!!!!!! We asked them to provide us details where do they get these numbers . Its estimate !!!!! We don't run a factory over here my response was . This company is shocking . Couple of months from now on and I got another 4 different numbers !!!!!! 2 weeks back I spoke to a guy on a phone and he asked me for a FINAL BILL for 190¬£ . I asked !!!! Is this the last final bill ??????? Is this the last number you coming out with ???? He said YES ! This morning I received another one for 585¬£ !!!!!!!!!!! This company is a mess !!!!!! They are just trying to get your money with some random different numbers every month !! Someone needs to check this company and make sure they are not trying to do this to anyone else. Phone conversations its another mess !!!! You speak to 20 different people ! No one knows what is actually going on and the best think is mostly they come out with some completely different random numbers and when you ask them where did you get these numbers from they tell you its estimate !!!!!!!!! Estimate for 4 months 2500¬£??????????????? This company is the worst hassle you will ever have to deal with . Never again BRITISH GAS !!!!! Wost experience ever !!!!! If I pay the final bill I BET in a couple of weeks there will be another bill coming !!! Another final bill ...... guys don't put yourself through this . The company is a mess and just trying to get out as much money as they can !!!!

absolute chaos with this company.  Changed from EON and they connected up my neighbour's meter by mistake.  Eventually got that sorted out and they managed my account fine for a few months, then they suddenly invented a duplicate account number and started writing to me as ""the occupier"" at the same address so I have two accounts.  They've opened their own complaint about it and are still looking into it.  I've no idea what I actually owe, so can't pay anything. Meanwhile I'm getting increasingly threatening letters from them and they've even referred one account to a credit control agency.  Whenever I call them about it they say they can't put me through to the complaints team who are looking into it because that team doesn't take incoming telephone calls so they will send an email asking that team to call me.  I never get a call.  You really couldn't make it up!  Terrible beyond belief.  Never, never ,never move to British Gas, they are appalling.  I'm going straight back to Eon if I can ever get this matter sorted out.

Have been harassed for months about a bill for a property after I had moved out despite having spoken, explained and gotten an apology only to receive letters and phone calls without knowledge to prior phone calls. Its outrageous. Spoke to them again today, explaining the situation for the 6th time, and the lady was extremely rude, not very apologetic and just said they were sending me the final bill!

Thief organisation. Effective private company monopoly (as opposed to state monopoly of a few years ago). Blatant profiteering from its most vulnerable customers ie elderly and those not equipped to use computers or the poor in precarious financial situations. British Gas say its because of government green policy (a joke surely - do you believe them?). They may be trying to pick your pocket to claw back the ¬£1 billion drop in profits from last year - so now you'll be safe in the knowledge that you can help those poor shareholders after such a tragedy for them. No new Mercs for them this year - awww....Government too weak to fix this failing private market. Capitalism without a conscience is destroying belief in the free market.  Switching is easy through USwitch or Martin Lewis. Do it and help others who struggle.

My recommendation is do not trust this bunch of cowboys with your hard earned cash. Better to save the money you would have spent each month into a kitty for unexpected repairs. My experience of British gas home care heating is appalling. Our hot water tank started leaking quite badly in April causing a minor flood. Upon contacting British gas we were told dyno rod would be attending to sort out the problem. Their engineer confirmed we needed the tank replacing and this was done a week later, bearing in mind that we had to push for it to be done as were without hot water during this time. When you pay ¬£800per year for this service you expect a certain level of commitment to customer care. That said, another engineer came to replace the tank. Slightly concerning was the fact that he seemed to spend a lot of time on the phone. When he eventually finished, he informed me that my shower pump was leaking, there had been nothing wrong with it prior to the fitting of the new tank. He went on to say that it was not down to him and that dyno rod don't cover shower pumps so there was nothing he could do. I employed a local plumber to inspect the pump, he confirmed it was damaged beyond repair. He took one look at the pipe work dyno rod had left us with and advised us to complain due to the shoddy workmanship. In addition to this he noticed the thermostat on the tank was set at 75degrees, much higher than the maximum 60 degrees for the pump and had likely caused the shower pump to break due to the extreme temperature of the water running through it. We did complain about this and the following day the water tank started leaking again from one of the ill fitted pipes and the central heating pump jammed, coincidental??!! a dyno rod engineer attended and said that the central heating pump was wired up wrong and that it was nothing to do with the previous dyno rod engineer's work but that he couldn't touch it as it was a British gas component . (do you see where I'm going with this!!). British gas then sent an engineer to fix the central heat pump, which to be fair he did and also sorted out air lock problems on the radiators we had experienced since the installation of the new tank. In all we have been badly let down by poor customer service (or lack of it). Our complaint was not taken seriously and we have been fobbed off. To make matters worse, when I inquired how much it would have cost to pay a local plumber to replace the tank I found it would have cost a fraction of what I wasted on British gas, plus a new shower pump that cost over ¬£300 and I now have to pay for the shoddy work carried out by dyno rod to be rectified as their operations manager deemed it satisfactory!!!

British Gas fitted my central heating boiler and from the outset it looked, and was, a disaster. Three years later is seems that the fitter had left out an essential flue gasket allowing carbon monoxide to leak into our kitchen and ‚Äòcondensate‚Äô to rot out the boiler‚Äôs combustion box, so a new boiler was needed. Their installation Manager suggested a solution that both the manufacturer and GasSafe say was unsafe. Their Area Manager fully supported this action so there is clearly a culture here that puts profit ahead of safety. British Gas would accept no responsibility, refused even communicate after the initial complaint contact, until the Retail Ombudsman was contacted and forced them to make reparation. Forget the sweet little penguin, simply leave them alone (or use them to set your maximum budget) and use a, locally recommended, GasSafe registered installer (ask to see their GasSafe badge and on the rear it will tell you if they are qualified to fit the type of device that you want fitted, or check out their credentials at www.gassaferegister.co.uk/find-an-engineer/ ). This will almost certainly cost you less and, from my experience, you and your family will probably be safer.
Top Tip: You can request, within six months of installation, that an inspector from the GasSafe Register checks that the work has been carried out correctly. This facility is quite difficult to find on their site, so here is the URL :-www.gassaferegister.co.uk/help-and-advice/gas-safety-in-the-home/having-a-new-appliance-fitted/nominate-your-appliances-for-inspection/

I rented a domestic flat around 18 months ago. It has no gas appliances and the gas supply was disconnected before the company I rented it from even bought the place. I didn't sign up for a gas account because I didn't need one. British Gas sent me a bill for over ¬£420 in standing charges for a disconnected gas meter in this building's basement. The previous landlord of the flat rented it to the building's caretaker, who did not close the business gas account, so my name was added to the account without my knowledge or agreement.
It has taken weeks to sort this mess out. Every time I have dealt with a different person at British Gas I have been told something different. The business customer services officer I registered my complaint with was useless. She provided me with incorrect information and just wanted me to pay up.
In my view they have a very iffy accounting system and some office staff do not appear to know what they are doing. Naturally, as they are a large utility supplier, they automatically assume that the customer is wrong. I will never use their services because of this.

Beware!! Online price checker is a rip off! Do not believe what British Gas Price Check tool advices you! I was a British Gas customer and my 12 month tariff was coming to an end. I switched from Collective Fix February 2017 tariff to HomeEnergy FreeTime Sat tariff earlier in 2017.

I have used British Gas Tariff Check tool. It advised me that I will end up paying around ¬£5 more a year by switching to HomeEnergy FreeTime Sat. Happy days! I do understand that it was an estimate and the final bill depends on my usage, but if the usage is the same I will end up paying ¬£5 more a year.

However, my bill from British Gas became significantly higher and not as advertised by the Tariff Check tool. For example, Jan 2017 I was on my old tariff and I have used 3024kw which was ¬£103.41. In March 2017 on the new tariff I used 1996kw which was 107.48. The difference is astonishing as you can see. I have used one third less energy, but ended up paying more. How does that work out ¬£5 more a year?

I had a engineer come do a annual boiler check, he ticked off all the checks and signed it off. Then the boiler filter started leaking! So i had to get another british gas engineer out to look at it, he actually knew what he was doing, but he said that the first engineer did not check it at all, it was impossible to check as it is locked/seized and wouldn't budge. So british gas rip you off, dont do the job correct and seeing as though it is GAS related it is a very serious matter! I had to fork over ¬£255 to British gas for a new ¬£80 filter to be installed to stop the leaking (1 hour to fit). Absolute joke, It wasn't leaking until the british gas guy came over, so i'm sure he tried to get into it and when he couldn't move it he left it slightly open. If it was leaking before he came then why has it been signed off? Why isn't there damaged chipboard flooring under the boiler? Chipboard doesn't do well with water so that says it all really.

Either way: he damaged it or didn't even check it and signed it off as checked!

British gas wouldn't or couldn't take my payment as their online payment kept refusing my credit card and wouldn't authorize it even though it worked fine everywhere else.
I communicated this to them that I had tried to pay my bill 8 times over the past month but their site was stopping me. They suggested or said nothing of any value so I emailed and said I would wait til they fix their site and a few weeks later I received a letter from a collection agency (debt collection) called Arvato.
They were nightmare number two as they dont answer their phones, they havent answered any of the two emails I sent them trying to pay or either of the two complaints procedures I went through or any of the 12 agent call backs I requested.
So now Im in a position where I have continually tried my best to pay this stupid bill doxens of times but everywhere I go they fail me with ignoring me. It seems as though its a ploy to put me in debt and charge extra costs for their mistakes.
The communication with BG was a complete joke speaking to a new person everytime I sent an email meant they had no idea what my story was so far and it all kept going round in circles with me telling the same story again and again. They are a pathetic don't care outfit of morons that dont know their arse from their elbow. As for Arvato they are equally as dumb and completely ignore people who are genuinely trying to just pay a bill.
These idiots wouldn't have a leg to stand on in court, my records from my bank clearly show repeated attempts to pay off the whole bill dozens of times but the British gas site isn't working as it should, they even said that to me yet transferred me to a debt collection agency. The fact the Arvato doesn't give a toss is another joke and also demonstrates that they are neglecting their duties also. Look on the glassdoor website to see what their own staff say about Arvato. Its a joke. These muppets should all be shut down

They put in the wrong address when I set up the account, I told them so many times and they did not change it. I called for engineer as I had a problem with my boiler and they sent him to the wrong address. When I booked the appointment the customer service team took me through security she really cares about her job as I gave her my home address and she did not pick up that there was another address on the account, if she did we could have resolved this at 1pm when I called. they re-booked for this morning between 8am and 10am surprise surprise no one showed, so I've canceled all 3 of my policies this morning.

Once you are their customer, they don't care you. They are good with their user interface, attractive pages and packages and customer service only till you buy their services.
They give you false promises, for example - if they are to inspect the gas hob or boiler and they fix an appointment, they don't turn up. You sit like a fool whole day wasting your holidays and earnings. They really don't care.
Also in case of emergency - like tap leaking or etc,. they again promise and fail to turn up.
This is because they are having lot of customers and they are in huge profits. They don't have enough resources. Even if someone turns up, they are very rude as if they doing the job for free.

Charged us a substantial amount for our final gas and electric bill wich they say is an estimated bill although we have always sent accurate readings my new supplier also sent them the readings. they have charged my account on two occasions within a few weeks of each other without any bills being sent to us letting us kno that we about to ripp you off wich could of gone against my credit history or debt with my bank if ther was no money in my account they did say we did send it but when i asked for a copy of it it's just a coincidence it wont let them send me another copy? Ye righ.Even after supplying metere readings they refused  to resolve. they tell you we will pass to our experts that have no clue. end result is they want me to contact our new suppliers and get them to send them meter readings when i can give them it and have. Also the customer sevice is a disgrace by faar the worst i was on phone with labona for over 45 mins wich she said she got to the bottom of and then cut it off and when i called back the lady i spoke to the second time had no clue as to what was going on because there was not much notes left so had to go through everything again only to be told that the bill is on my wife's  name and they cant discuss with me becuse its data protection but have never had them ask this before this begs the question is our data safe in the hands of british gas? I will never recommend this company or its services to anyone again they should be ashamed to call themselves British gas if you are with this company i feel sorry for you. My fisrt call was made to labona at 11.07 on the 11/3/17 i don't normally leave reviews but new customers to british gas be aware

Looking to have your boiler serviced by British Gas - DON'T! 

We have now been without heat/gas for two days due to the incompentence of British Gas Engineer! Our boiler was working perfectly well and reluctantly we had to have it serviced as per the Homecare contract, also we also had a small leak from one of the radiators.  Engineer eventually came on the third time the appointment was made.  The excuses were he had to go on 'emergency' call-outs.  Pity he came on Tuesday 7 Feb he came to carry out the work.  Next morning we could smell gas!  Called the emergency services. SGN, who promptly sealed off our gas supply saying that there were two gas leaks coming from the boiler serviced by the British Gas Engineer! Rang British Gas to ask for an Engineer to attend to the leaks.  They said that they were unable to get an Engineer to us until the next day! Asked why we couldn't have an emergency appointment as we had foregone our appointment for emergencies  twice.  Were told we were not in that category i.e. did not have a baby or inactive elderly person! My husband is 70 and I am 61. Appointment made and confirmation sent by text for the next day. Next day we noticed the leaking radiator which was supposed to be fixed was still leaking! Waited in for the elusive Engineer. Although in constant contact with British Gas Team that day, assuring us the Engineer would be calling, he didn't!.  Was told there was a failure in their booking system! Not surprised as they are dealt with in India!  Lost in translation or not concerned about their customers??  British Gas try to obtain new Homecare customers with propganda on the web when they clearly are not able to deal with their existing customers! Here are some of the quotes from their website trying to entice new customers, which are total lies as we are still without heat/gas!!!

We‚Äôve got over 6,000 engineers ready to help you get your central heating and hot water back on.  

Well they couldn't find ONE for us!!

You can call us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We‚Äôre there whenever you need us whether you're a customer or not. 

Sure you can, but you will still be without heat due to the incompentence of their engineer!! 

Our engineers call ahead so you know they're on their way.

Still waiting for the call!!

Also looks like my Tweets have been deleted from British Gas Twitter page!!

I recent lost my job last year due to ill health. I am on payment cards for gas and electricity, paid fortnightly. 3 times I rang up to say I was struggling and those 3 times I spoke to three different  people. They were very understanding and helpful. They never swore, never threatened me with a pre-payment meter. I didn't have to start paying again for six weeks  to give me time to get things sorted out, naturally  my payments increased to cover my missed payments  but it was not by much. Installed a smart meter which is excellent, turned up on time. My partner has been with British gas for over 20 years,  she also never had any problems  and has got boiler care.  All representatives  I have spoken to have been polite.  The problem with some people when they get into money problems,  instead of getting in touch to sort things out they just leave it. I would  recommend  British gas to anyone.

Shocking customer service, abysmal response and useless dispute resolution.  Failed to update my details, even to the point they said I wasn't a customer, despite taking my money by DD. 
They used false meter readings to bill, blaming me for the previous supplier giving them incorrect information.  They also put me on a standard tariff when I asked for a fixed tariff.  

Oh, and when I moved home they continued to charge me for a homecare service on the previous property, despite being informed of my new address AND they set up a new service for the guy that bought my old place, so it's not like they didn't know.

Absolutely the worst energy supplier - and when you consider how bad some of the others are, this really is a dreadful indictment.

Don't even think about signing up to British Gas. It's way more expensive than the other companies for both gas and electricity plus they have 26p per day standing charge for both meters ( Electricity and Gas) no matter what type of meter you get, PYG, Prepaid or smart meter. 

Also Customer service is the worst, they swear at customers, 3 different people from British Gas hanged up on me in one day.

I have been British Gas Home Care customer for a long time. When I joined the plan, a BG engineer was visiting us within 24 hours.  They asked about the fault and tried to fix it asap.  I contacted them on Saturday morning and an engineer was only available on Monday afternoon.  They have not asked about the fault code or what happened, so I worry that it would take more time and visits before they can fix it. It is late autumn and the cold front has arrived to London.

Never have I recieved such awful customer service or appaling treatement. On the 10th February I received a visit from an Engineer and what can only be described as a women hating, intimidating Warrant Office to inform me that I have a large debt with British Gas and that pre-payment meters will replace the standard one that I had. This Warrant Officer refused to show me the paperwork when I asked, stating that I would‚Äôve received it and implied that I was lying when I told him I have received no letters from British Gas (Please note I have proof that British Gas has been sending lots of letters addressed to me to the wrong address ‚Äì this has only just been changed on your system due to British Gas‚Äô error and not mine). Several times the Warrant Office raised his voice to me and pointed in my face while doing so my children were stood behind me shaking with fear and crying from being so scared. I asked him on several occasions to stop shouting at me and pointing in my face, when I asked him to show me his ID badge as I wanted to know his name to complain he would not show it to me. In a letter from Laura Mortin ‚Äì Customer Specialist at British Gas, she stated that the Warrant Office advised his ID badge was on display. This is an outrageous lie as he had his hand held machine (I believe an iPad but could be a tablet) held in front of it while snarling at me. Please note that the engineer who attended with him heard and saw all of this and I would expect him to tell the truth. The engineer was the only person to enter my property as my two young daughters were petrified I‚Äôd let the ‚Äúbig bully‚Äù in from outside (Those are the words my 4 year old used). I am disgusted that British Gas employs and sends people like that out to intimidate and scare their customers (and their children).

As it turns out you had the incorrect address for me. You‚Äôve been supplying 2b with gas and Electric but have been sending all correspondence to 28. I have spoken to the people at 28 who have confirmed they‚Äôve received a lot of letters with my name and they‚Äôve been sending letters back marked with not known or addressee unknown. They are willing to make a statement to that affect.

Due to British Gas‚Äô mistake not only have I been forced to pay outrageous costs for gas and electric through the pre-payment meter but I was actually charge for that privilege of them installing the god awful meters! 

Knowing the above facts about British Gas‚Äô blatant mistakes I‚Äôm unsure why you are refusing to change my meters back from the Pre-Payment meters. I‚Äôve already tried to explain that I would‚Äôve been willing to pay more than the ¬£6.50 each a week and that the debt mounted up was because of me not receiving one letter or phone call about this. 

Even after explaining about the above address issues and telling British Gas my address is 2b and not 28, the reply to my original complaint was sent the 28. Is it any wonder I haven‚Äôt been getting letters when you are still sending them to the wrong address.

On haart radio there was an advert for 50% off on new boilers. Called to ask for a price. Their call centre guy was really arrogant and rude. Asked him to put me through to someone else please and he will keep asking why, then British Gas sent someone over to price the boiler and the cost was ¬£3600+. Which is the double cost for the same boiler as my friend had it for only ¬£1500 along with installation. Moral of the story, just don't accept the price and buy it if it says *half a price*

My advice is to steer well clean of this corporate leviathan. If you have a problem and it doesn't fit neatly into one of their 'categories' you haven't a hope in hell of getting it resolved.

British Gas have our domestic property mistakenly listed as a business. Despite three years worth of letters, emails, phone calls and promises we are still listed as a business.

We recently tried leaving British Gas, desperate to be rid of the incompetence, but they wont let us leave as we are a (Yep, you guessed it) 'business customer' trying to join a 'domestic' tarrif at another supplier. apparently 'computer says no'.

I've now threatened to camp out at corporate HQ

When I refused it explaining i don‚Äôt like them, they don‚Äôt work, I lose my white meter the person to whom I was speaking didn‚Äôt even know what my White Meter was. 

I have been asking this company ever since we were migrated to them, without our knowledge to check our accounts as two elderly people, me disabled and a cat do not use the amount of energy they are charging us. Still waiting and have been waiting for three tears now.

I should also add they don‚Äôt even ask for our Readings anymore I photograph our readings then email it to this ridiculous company and wait for an even worse bill. Will someone please help.

The customer service is extremely poor, with numerous complaints submitted through WhatsApp messenger. This platform is inefficient for customer communication, with an average wait time exceeding 5 hours, often longer. The Smart Meter is utterly pointless, providing inaccurate charges. The current usage displayed on the EON app contradicts the Smart Meter, amounting to false advertising and an inability to monitor my bill accurately. Despite raising these concerns with EON in August, I continue to receive varied responses from different advisors. A complaint was lodged months ago, yet I have not received any response despite my persistent follow-ups.

Eon Next team:Kerry Owen and Eric Bromley

I'm absolutely appalled at the way our business has been treated! We paid a hefty ¬£1,000+ deposit due to the previous tenant's unpaid bill, with the understanding it'd be refunded upon switching suppliers. It's been TWO MONTHS, and we're still waiting for our money!

Not only did EON attempt to pacify us by sending a cheque of ¬£400 (incorrectly addressed) despite us settling all bills, but the communication has been abysmal. As a small business, we rely on every penny. Legal action is in the works, but we shouldn't have to resort to that. 

We have been forced to continue this conversation with EON publicly and will continue to do so on every social and review based platform available aswell as consumer protection agencies until we have our due refund transferred to us IN FULL.
 
As a small business, every penny counts. 
Resolve this IMMEDIATELY! We demand the respect and fairness we deserve.

My mother died but instead of putting the account into my name like all the other companies I had to deal with example water, BT, gas. EON would not instead insisting tpo put the account into executor of deceased. I told them I was not the executor, that there was no Will or probate or letters of admin because value of estate was very small, but they never listen. So now I cannot change the name even though I own the house,and when I sell they will not allow it to change because the executor can only change it and there isn't no such person. Any credit owed will be sent by cheque to executor so cannot be cashed because there is no executor,but if monies owed then they call me an executor and liable to pay them but for them to pay me I have to prove I am the executor by showing a will, probate or letters of admin all of which as the know I do not have. So according to them I am liable for all electricity bills till I die and they have stolen ¬£300 of my mothers money when she died. What a awful company

Rubbish,rubbish and rubbish again. Stay away from this company. I purchased my property over 2 years ago and from day 1 of joining them I have had nothing but rubbish from them. First problems were with my new account, previous owner had died but company insisted I was her - eventually sorted after umpteen attempts for them to understand the word ""deceased"".   I then start having problems with payments, finally get that sorted then problems trying to get a Smart meter and that was over 2 years ago and STILL they won't give me one, apparently I already have one when I clearly DON'T, then after covid they decided they would increase my monthly payments by over  ¬£200 which I politely told them NO they won't. Eventually sorted that but only because I threatened them with legal advice. I now only pay them for what I use, I will not pay them a set amount each month and I don't care if it costs me a couple of quid more, at least this way I know what I owe and it gets paid and they dont have my money sitting in their banks earning interest for themselves. STILL NO SMART METER so when I keep seeing all these adverts in the media and on TV I want to scream as they make it sound so simple to just get one when in reality it's a nightmare or is that just this horrendous insulting company whose staff think it's ok to lie, insult and belittle their customers, those of us who actually pay their wages as I pointed out to an arrogant little !!! one day after I was fed up with listening to his rubbish about how it's my own fault apparently that I don't have a meter, as I pointed out he should have a little more respect for his customers and that I and many more people pay his wages, he just said ""No you don't, the company does"" I rest my case about this company being useless !!!

I have literally spent years trying to get E.ON Next to set up a direct debit. Simple? Apparently not. As arrears accrued and I continued to try to get them to set up a direct debit and then payment plan to no avail, E.ON unlawfully harassed me with texts and threats. I took my complaint to the ombudsman and he upheld it. I then asked E.ON yet again to set up a payment plan. Guess what? All I had in response to my multiple emails were more threatening texts from them. The ombudsman 
 even contacted my ‚Äòcase handler‚Äô at E.ON to try to get them to comply without any result. 

Husain of the 'Escalated Complaints' team agreed they had provided exceptionally poor service...and then proceeded to provided even worse service, again failing to set up a payment plan, promising me that they would stop any form of collection activity while dealing with my complaint when they had already passed it on to debt collectors in breach of FCA rules and deadlocking the complaint when he had backed himself into a corner, claiming that I had refused to progress it. 

I even went so far as to email the CEO of EON in Germany as well as in the UK. Neither had the courtesy to respond. E.ON Next will lie, cheat and steal with impunity.

On closing my a/c with E-on a cheque was issued to me for ¬£159.14. They spelt my name incorrectly Davis instead of Davies! I have made several phone calls to get the cheque reissued. The original complaint has gone on from April 2022 it is now September 2023. With this cheque issued 7 months ago. Agents assure me the replacement cheque will be posted with 2 weeks but it never arrives. Now they want me to take this simple request to the ombudsman!! How ridiculous! What & wait another 7 months.?????

AVOID Eon Next like the plague if you value your mental health. These greedy, unprofessional and unethical leeches have harassed and abused me everyday for over a year causing me unbearable stress.
Over a year ago, you wrote to me saying that you are sorry for not sending me gas bills and that the account setup error was your fault. All this while I was paying the agreed montly payment by DD. You then unceremoniously dropped a bill of over ¬£1,300 and threatened to increase my DD to over ¬£500 per month. For a family of 2 that did not make any sense. When I asked you to account for the charges, you got caught and had no choice but to refund me. That's when I knew I was dealing witha bunch of SCAMMERS. I warned you I will cancel my DD if you cannot accurately account for what I was being fraudlently charged.

I have completed payment of the amount you have claimed I owed and switched to OCTOPUS ENERGY, who have been so amazing that I wonder how you lot are still in business. I'm sure its only a matter of time before you are caught with your corrupt practices and go bust!

I note that a total of ¬£50 has been corruptly and heartlessly added to the account being so-called late payment fees/debt collector fees etc.I have been paying ¬£400 each month to pay for your error but that does not mean a thing when you are blinded by greed.
HELL WILL HAVE TO FREEZE FIRST BEFORE YOU GET A CENT OF THAT ¬£50.
I will vigorously defend this position in any court and I put you on notice that if there is any negative impact on my credit record due to your callousness, unprofessionalism and outright greed, be prepared to explain your nastiness in court.

On 8th December 2022, I got involved in an accident. While I was still dazed and trying to get to grips with the situation, your E.ON next representative called me. I answered thinking it was the insurance company or police and when I explained to him that I've just been in an accident, instead of hanging up, the guy kept on insisting that if I cannot talk now I must give him a time for him to call back to discuss my energy account! That is the height of insensitivity.
Enough of the abuse!

This has been an incredibly disappointing experience for me. I've encountered a complete lack of transparency with Eon Next. The call centre representatives have provided false information, and the bills I've received seem ad-hoc with no valid explanations. I've noticed random charges appearing and disappearing without any clear reasoning behind them. Even more frustrating is that I receive calls from ten different people on the same day, yet none seem capable of providing a resolution.

I'm left with serious doubts about this company. It's baffling how they could forget to charge us for a whole month and then suddenly remember it after ten months, all without any explanation. When I brought this issue to their attention, they added around 20 more deductions and charges, further complicating matters.

I'm deeply disappointed that I haven't received a satisfactory solution to these problems. I strongly advise against placing trust in Eon Next and suggest avoiding their services altogether. Even my landlord, who has been dealing with them for two years, has an ongoing dispute with them, which speaks to the recurring issues they seem to have.

This company is beyond the pale. I pay by DD every month, send readings every month and always have. In June 22 I was ¬£253 in credit but despite this and ¬£400 given to eon by the gov they send me an ""estimated""bill in july for ¬£1400. I've had no heating on since Apr, boil the kettle 3 times a day max, laundry 1 per month, it's a 1 bed flat and I live alone. Customer service is useless and clearly have a set dismissive answer to all complaints. I've phoned 7 times and as other reviewers have said, they say they'll look into it and call back. I've had no call backs. 6 weeks ago they tell me billing will look into it and resolve it, no call back but they added another ¬£200 to my again ""estimated"" bill. I called again today and they assure me its correct as its a catch up bill because there was a long period with no readings which is a lie, I send a reading each month. Then he says we can offer ways to help - the line went dead leaving me fuming. I don't have the money and have no idea what to do. I am partially sighted and have no income. Avoid these parasites, they'll break you.

Avoid this company at all costs. Different amounts applied throughout the month but no one can answer questions regarding prices and usage! They have suddenly hit me with a debit of almost ¬£1400 which I only realised when I spotted my upcoming direct debit was about to double in order to clear the debt! I‚Äôve now been trying to resolve this for weeks and unbelievably was advised by ‚ÄòEmily‚Äô to cancel the direct debit and wait for a debt collection agency to ring me when I asked to pay my original amount going forward and then at least ¬£80 extra over the phone each month until I catch up! Everything offered was refused, despite the fact they advertise that they are there to help if people are struggling! We were then offered ¬£50 compensation if we agree to cancel our complaint which is in actual fact bribery! I‚Äôve never known a company who refuse an offer of payment and tell you to cancel your payment arrangements which just puts you more in debt! No mention of how this bill has suddenly gone so far into debit just a massive bill and no help or a reasonable effort to come to a realistic solution! Impossible to speak to a manager or be given the number to contact one and no one ever rings back when they say they will. Awful, rude and dismissive staff who are patronising and make you feel small! Avoid at all costs unless you‚Äôve got money to burn!

A CATALOGUE OF INCOMPETENCE, FICTITIOUS BILLS & HARASSMENT - AVOID THIS COMPANY!

About nine years ago, I moved into a rented flat in South London. The flat was electric-only, and E-ON were the energy supplier for the previous tenant, so contacted them to inform them I‚Äôd moved in and set-up an account with them. It was the top floor flat of a house conversion, with one ground floor flat and one basement flat beneath mine and three separate electric meters in an outside cupboard under the front stairs to the property. I was told by the letting agent, my electric meter was the middle one, so gave E-ON an initial reading from that meter on the day I moved in, which was accepted, and over the years I paid E-ON by card as soon as I received a bill via email and entered meter readings on their website taken from that middle electric meter every so often when requested. 

INCOMPETENCE EXAMPLE ONE:
I received a meter reading request email from E-ON in early July 2021, so went down to the meter cupboard, took a reading from the usual middle meter, but the E-ON website wouldn‚Äôt let me enter it in the meter reading fields of my account portal. After several failed attempts, I noticed the meter serial number on the meter readings page had been changed, so went back down to the meter cupboard outside to cross-reference that number with my meter, only to discover that number now corresponded to the meter on the right and not the middle meter that I had been giving readings from for years.

The middle flat directly below mine was untenanted at the time, so couldn‚Äôt query anything there, so I emailed E-ON to ask why the associated meter had been changed on my account. I was asked to take and email E-ON photos of both meters, which resulted in an eventual reply from the ‚ÄúEon Next Energy Specialist‚Äù stating the meter on the right was the one attached to my flat and that the amount owing was almost ¬£300!

Each month, I had been used to paying around ¬£60 per month for my electric usage, so a ¬£300 bill was a more than a shock, so continued to query the following with E-ON;
- If the meter on the right was the one attached to the flat, why had E-ON been accepting readings on the middle meter for years?
- Why had E-ON been accepting payments based on the middle meter readings for years?
- Why, all of a sudden, had I been switched to another meter?
- What evidence did they have (I.E. a confirmation letter from the National Grid) that the meter on the right was 100% my electric meter?

Despite sending numerous emails to E-ON, I received no answers to any of my questions. No evidence as to why the meter on the right was deemed to be mine. Instead I received a barrage of texts and paper bills demanding payment and threatening further action if I didn‚Äôt pay.

I went back to my online portal to see if I could record the discrepancy between meter readings and an obvious switch to another meter, but the readings history had been wiped and only ‚Äúestimated readings‚Äù remained based on the meter on the right. With no evidence to the contrary, I was left with no choice but to find the money to pay E-ON, as I didn‚Äôt want to be taken to court and incur more fees. Although, I do still have the email chain with the ‚ÄúEon Next Energy Specialist‚Äù, which I will be providing to the ombudsman and my solicitor, if required.

INCOMPETENCE EXAMPLE TWO:
I completed on the purchase of a flat in South London and received the keys on April 28, 2023. As the new flat required major work to remove the gas boiler (and install an electric immersion heater instead), gas cooker (and install an electric cooker instead), seven gas radiators (and install 3 electric radiators and an electric heated towel rail instead) and an electric shower, I didn‚Äôt move into the new flat until May 14th, 2023. 

I informed E-ON that May 14th, 2023 would be my final day in the rented flat, provided them with a final electric meter reading, which they accepted, and was eventually sent the final bill for that property, which I paid and received an email receipt for.

I went straight to the new flat, after collecting the keys on April 28th, where I discovered a ‚ÄúTo the Occupier‚Äù letter from E-ON addressed to my flat. I opened it, only to find out that the previous tenants (the flat was previously a rental before I bought it) had run-up a gas and electric bill totalling ¬£2,016.14 and had moved out without paying. I took photos of both the gas and electric meters and readings, emailed them to E-ON along with documented proof that the purchase of the flat had completed on April 28th, 2023 and I had not been living at the flat prior to April 28th. The E-ON representative I spoke to said she had accepted these on the system and that I wouldn‚Äôt be liable to pay the previous occupiers of this flat‚Äôs bill and my liability for gas and electric would start from April 28th, 2023.

CONTINUED:

Since then, there have been numerous letters sent via post to this address, both from E-ON addressed ‚ÄúTo the occupier‚Äù and from a debt collection agency on behalf of E-ON addressed directly to Mr Lukasz Wierzbicki and Mrs Joanna Wierzbicka demanding payment for the aforementioned amount, with debt collectors stating they are likely to call round to my flat to ‚Äúrecover the amount owed‚Äù.

INCOMPETENCE EXAMPLE THREE:
As this was a new home for me, and following my previous dissatisfaction with E-ON, I opted to switch suppliers to Octopus Energy on May 13th, 2023. As the flat now no longer contained any gas-powered appliances, etc, I signed-up as an electric-only customer. 

Although, I didn‚Äôt realise, until the plumber I had employed to carry out the aforementioned work on my flat told me that I would still be charged a daily standing order for the rental of the gas meter, even though I wasn‚Äôt using any gas at the property. He informed me that I should get the gas meter removed or I would continue to pay for a gas supply and meter that I wasn‚Äôt using. 

I contacted Octopus Energy, who informed me that, as I had registered as an electric-only customer, they couldn‚Äôt action the removal of the gas meter and I would have to contact my previous supplier E-ON to arrange a gas engineer to remove it.

After five days of getting the run around by various E-ON customer service agents, either via phone or via email (and every day getting charged for the rental of a gas meter I wasn‚Äôt using), I was informed they could send a Gas Engineer to my flat for the fee of ¬£148.32, which I paid E-ON, and an engineer came to my flat and removed the meter and capped off the gas supply on May 24th, 2023.

Just before the meter was removed and the gas was capped off, I took and sent E-ON a photo of the gas meter and reading on May 24th, to prove no gas had been used since I took possession of the flat on April 28th). I also paid in full the standing charge for the gas meter rental and all electric used from April 28th up to the date Octopus Energy took over as my electricity suppliers. I received a final payment receipt on June 22, 2023 and a ‚Äúsorry you‚Äôre leaving us‚Äù email from E-ON, and assumed that was the end of the matter and my association with E-ON.

INCOMPETENCE EXAMPLE(S) FOUR:
- JULY 12, 2023 I receive an email from E-ON asking for a meter reading.

- AUGUST 5, 2023 I receive an email bill for ¬£2,825.46 from E-ON for a period of ‚ÄúGas usage‚Äù from 15th June - 4th August 2023.

- AUGUST 5, 2023 I telephoned E-ON and asked one of their customer service people why I have received this, ESPECIALLY WHEN I PAID THEM TO HAVE THE GAS METER REMOVED AND CAPPED OFF, and why my account was still active. I was told ‚Äúthey would look into it.‚Äù

- AUGUST 17, 2023 I receive an email bill from E-ON, this time associated with my previous rented flat, asking for a sum of ¬£15.69 for a period from July 9th - 13th, 2023.

- AUGUST 17, 2023 I emailed E-ON‚Äôs complaint dept, as I handed the keys back to that property on May 14th and haven‚Äôt even been near that flat since May 14, let alone been inside it using electricity. I also made a complaint about the HUGE gas bill I was sent for my current property for the period of time after I paid E-ON to have the gas meter removed and settled my finals bills. I also wanted to know why I was still registered as an E-ON customer, after being with Octopus for over three months.

- AUGUST 22, 2023 I finally received a reply from E-ON Customer Complaints, asking me for a clear picture of the meter and the meter reading! A PICTURE OF A NOW NON-EXISTENT METER THAT I PAID THEM TO REMOVE 3 MONTHS AGO!!!

- AUGUST 22, 2023 I replied with a screen grab of the email I‚Äôd previously received confirming the payment to remove the meter and transaction ID, which they should have had on their system and also recounted much of the above statement to them.

- AUGUST 30, 2023 I receive text message from E-ON asking me for a meter reading.

- AUGUST 30, 2023 I receive a letter from E-ON demanding I ‚Äúpay your balance of ¬£2,825.46‚Äù

- AUGUST 30, 2023 I receive an email from a different person at E-ON saying ‚ÄúI've personally raised a complaint on your account so that we can resolve this as quickly as possible for you.‚Äù So, my previous complaint didn‚Äôt count, but Jessica @E-ON‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonal complaint‚Äù now will?

- AUGUST 31, 2023 I reply to ‚ÄúJessica‚Äù at E-ON Customer Services, again stating the same problems I‚Äôm having and asking for confirmation that my name has been removed from their system and both accounts have been closed, just like I was lead to believe they had been when I made final payments on both.

- AUGUST 31, 2023 I receive an email from E-ON. This time, it‚Äôs Samantha stating:
‚ÄúI hope you're well I can confirm that the change over for Flat 15 is in process but it's not fully completed until we receive a finalised gas reading from your new supplier.

Once we get that it will no longer be possible for you to be charged. For the moment I have reversed all charges to before the 20th of May.

There has been no notification of a change over for 21C Mosslea Road yet and the process will the the same where we will wait for the Change of Supply Read to confirm a supply switch over.

Once these are received these, we can remove some but not all your data as it's a legal requirement to keep some information on file.

Please let us know if you need anything else,‚Äù

- AUGUST 31, 2023 I replied with a photo of the space in the kitchen where the gas meter was and now only two capped-off gas pipes remain, asking how anyone can send a meter reading from a gas meter that no longer exists? A METER THAT I PAID E-ON TO HAVE REMOVED MONTHS AGO!

- AUGUST 31, 2023 I receive this reply from Samantha:
‚ÄúI'm sorry, I realise this is frustrating.

Thank you for sending the meter picture.I will attach it to the account for future reference. I know you have sent us a reading in the past when you first moved in but did you record a final reading when the meter was removed? An estimate has been produced using the reading you gave us and as we have nor received a reading form this meter for a long time the billing is not as accurate as we would have liked.

I have taken note of your dissatisfaction for the I'm sorry I didn't pick up on this issue right away and didn't get it right the first time but I'll use what you have said to learn how to deliver a better service in future.‚Äù

As mentioned above, I sent them a metre reading from the day the meter was removed, so they could see no gas was used from the day I received the keys for the property, until the day the meter was removed. I paid all final bills to E-ON for both this and my previous rented property and received receipts to prove payment. 

- AUGUST 31, 2023 I receive a text from E-ON saying ‚ÄúYour balance of ¬£2825.46 is still overdue. Just click on this link ‚Ä¶. Thanks , E-ON Next.‚Äù

My best friend died of Cancer recently, and I‚Äôm currently in isolation, feeling like death as I have just tested positive for Covid, so REALLY don‚Äôt need E-ON harassing me to pay bills that aren‚Äôt mine left by previous occupiers of this flat, fictitious bills generated for gas supplies that aren‚Äôt connected and trying to charge me for energy usage for properties I‚Äôve not lived in for weeks. I‚Äôve kept all correspondence, all evidential proof of all their harassment and incompetence, which I will be passing on to the ombudsman and my solicitor if necessary. 

AVOID EVER SIGNING UP WITH A E-ON AS YOUR ENERGY SUPPLIER. THEY‚ÄôRE USELESS WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE A CUSTOMER, THEY DON‚ÄôT LISTEN AND THEY DON‚ÄôT SEEM TO WANT TO LET YOU LEAVE WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE NO LONGER A CUSTOMER OF THEIRS!!

I gave up counting at 50 ONE-STAR REVIEWS IN A ROW on Trust Pilot. Clearly, the reviews here are no better.

It does not surprise me that Eon Next just got fined ¬£5 MILLION pounds for terrible customer service, in my opinion, they got off lightly.

Due to the aftermath of Covid and myself being out of the country and not receiving mail, my account had gotten in arrears. I agreed to a payment plan for a ¬£772.79 bill with Eon Next. This was paid up in full quickly as agreed, alongside my regular electricity payments with Eon Next. I have documentation from them to show the account is up to date and all payments have been made in full. However, what they didn‚Äôt tell me when they arranged their crooked payment plan was that they had already sold the debt to CVS Law (another scam and bullying company), so Eon Next was in fact, essentially double dipping. So, the whole time I was innocently honouring my agreement and paying my bills, I was oblivious to the fact that they had sold the debt. As I was out of the country, I received nothing on this and thought it was all handled until last week when the bailiffs showed up at a friend‚Äôs house where I receive mail sometimes, and demanded payment or they would break down the door and come in and claim goods to the value of ¬£1391.28 they initially said over ¬£1900 but then changed the amount. Because this was not my home, and I felt bullied by their threats, I paid it, putting my bank account in arrears.  Not only has Eon Next not apologized, but they have arrogantly been of ZERO assistance whatsoever and are refusing to help in any way to get this rectified, just passing the buck to CST Law (the company they sold the debt to) who neither return phone calls, nor emails. Eon Next tells  me the department that deals with this sort of thing (clearly it happens a lot) is internal and cannot be reached by the public, in my opinion, this is just code speak for ‚Äúthey have scammed so many people they are overwhelmed and cannot deal directly with their victims‚Äù

My concern is that Eon Next will scam more unsuspecting and vulnerable people and cause even more heartache and damage affecting the mental health of their victims. Eon Next should not be allowed to stay in business. I can back all this up with emails and paperwork. 

RUN do not walk away from this awful company Eon Next, they are heartless and I am not sure how they have been allowed to stay in business.

Built up a substantial amount of credit with e-on over a few years of them over charging me for gas and electric. When I tried to claim it back they made it extremely difficult, after speaking to multiple people over several months I did end up with it back in my account but it was extremely painful.

On another property I had the same problem which I never managed to get back, they just send you round in circles with all their staff saying different things.

The final strike was when their engineers came to fit smart meters and ruined my carpets. Stains left next to the gas and electric meters where they've trodden in something or spilled oil on the carpets which won't come out.

Had nothing but issues with e-on and I wouldn't recommend going with them, I certainly won't be.

After making a complaint about my carpets they've said they can't do anything about it and wouldn't accept any responsibility.

A company and CEO without ethics
A Eon Next saga now going on for over five weeks and at least twenty emails. The story. They sent me a bill for ¬£130.96. I paid by credit card. They took ¬£1,136.96. I asked for my money back. Very easy to do using my credit card. But they said ‚Äúread the meter‚Äù. Told them as a disabled elderly person, with meter 7 feet high I could not climb to read it. No answer from Eon Next. I asked them to send someone to read the meter. No answer. Then no answers to at least the next eight emails. Finally someone said they would send me a cheque. Why on a credit card transactions they couldn't just credit the massive amount they'd over taken, don't know. So I waited, and waited, and waited for the cheque. Remember Eon Next have taken ¬£1,000 from me. But no cheque arrived. From my experience in business if the employees of a company have no ethics, no morals, it usually means the man at the top has none. So please step forward CEO of Eon Next Chris Norbury and say something. Eon Next too big to care, a company that you should avoid at all costs and never trust them with a DD....the Eon Next reply below is the sixth person to say ""can I help"" then I give them all the deatils and...zilch. All the fact are stated above. If they really want to help then give me back my money they took out of my credit card. Simple. It is getting on for six weeks since I first contacted them.
AFTER SEVEN WEEKS OF COMPLAINING, AT LEAST TWENTY EMAILS, PROMISES FROM THEM TO TAKE ACTION, TOLD THEY HAVE SENT MY MONEY BY CHEQUE, NOW 15 DAYS AND NOTHING...EXCEPT A STANDARD LETTER TO SAY LOOKING INTO YOUR COMPLAINT. EON NEXT INCOMPETENT OR LIERS. TAKE YOUR PICK

I had the worst experience ever and all that without ever being a client. 

One day, out of nowhere they started sending me letters claiming I owe them money for electricity. The bill was for my old address for the period of time when I was not living there anymore and I have always been a client of another provider. After sending then an email with registration proof and date, as well as multiple infolinie calls, they keeps bothering me with the letters and in the end, they forwarded me to Inkasso. Inkasso cancelled all activities towards me nearly immediately after finding out I actually don't owe them anything but it costed me so much stress, and time. I was so upset about the Inkasso but even after crying on the infolinie they wouldn't apologise or send an official letter with explanation. 

Worst company ever, I'd never recommend them to anyone. Terrible service, no English speakers, people on the infolinie tell you they will contact other department or do something about it and they never do, all the bill reminders were being sent two weeks after payment deadline, absolutely horrible and draining experience.

Stay away from the corrupted scumbags at eon. I moved into my private rented home 20th may. Eon was the supplier. Cut a long story short, I checked my credit score yesterday and it's dropped -193 points. The reason for this is because the corrupted scumbags at eon have informed credit reference agencies that I have 3 missed payments. March, April and May. Let me repeat myself, I moved into my private rented home 20th may. My supplier at my old address was EDF. There is NO missed payments with eon. And my supplier now is octopus energy. I of course complained to eon about this LIE. The response I received via email was . . . I am sorry to see this credit marker on your credit file . . . 
I have informed ofgem and also the energy ombudsman. Eon have not learnt from the last time they were in trouble. If anything they have gotten worse. Now I'm with octopus energy the usage I'm using is 5x less the amount I was using with eon. Need I say more of how corrupted they are. I can see eon being investigated (if they are not already) once again.

Appalling customer service
Firstly an engineer came out for an RTS survey when I had first moved into my new flat, he told me the last engineer who came out had left the meter box unsafe and that if I had touched a part of it I‚Äôd have been electrocuted! he fortunately was able to make it safe while he was there. It was noted that the meter was broken and a smart meter would need to be fitted.

I spent days trying to get through to someone to arrange for my meter to be replaced, I had spoken to over 10 different ‚Äúenergy specialists‚Äù to get an engineer to come out, however no one had a clue how to sort this so I was promised a call back time and time again no one bothered to call me back. The amount of times there had been system errors meaning no one had been able to contact me was ridiculous.

When the engineer was finally able to fit the meter weeks later he was unable to fit the smart meter part as promised because the office hadn‚Äôt set something up correctly, again another system problem their end.

I was told that the issue had been escalated and prioritised yet no one is able to get me an appointment for the smart meter to be fitted after another 2 weeks waiting. 

There‚Äôs still other unresolved issues 2 months later everything that could go wrong has gone wrong! 

This company does not have a complains procedure, you can report a complaint but nothing will be done about it no one really seems to care, communication within the company is non-existent.

I have asked to have the issue escalated and still no call back from a manager as I requested, I‚Äôm now seeking advice from the Ombudsman because I have no other options and I‚Äôm losing the will to live. 

I‚Äôm not normally one to complain but I‚Äôve wasted hours dealing with this company they have caused me so much stress and anxiety. I‚Äôve never dealt with such an awful company in my life, would rate less than 1 star if I could, please please please avoid at all costs!!!

Eon Next are horrible, incompetent and do not value their customers as I experienced major issues with a gas pay meter and was lied to by Eon Next on numerous occasions in which I was told that my meter must run out before an engineer can be sent (idiotic policy from a cheap skate company) at any time for an emergency appointment yet when the meter ran out on more than one occasion in -0 temperatures and a young child in the home which Eon Next was fully aware of yet they refused to send anyone out.
You will wait for well over an hour if you call them and the problems I experienced went for longer than 2 months resulting in 20 phone calls which resulted in a total of 20 HOURS ON HOLD.
I have been promised call backs by managers on 3 occasions but AGAIN Eon Next lied and no one called due to them having no sense of customer service and not valuing their customers.
The stress that this caused is so unacceptable and the best advice I can give is to STAY AWAY FROM Eon Next as I have been hung up on by their staff when they struggled to resolve my horrible situation and this happened numerous times as they are beyond incompetent.
In the end I was offered an insulting ¬£50 compensation.

In 2018 I had my both my upper and lower teeth replaced by EON. All went well, and even though it cost tens of thousands of dollars, I believed I was set for life. Then my teeth started to break even though I believe I was very careful. Often the repairs lasted less than 24 hours and I had to take time out of my schedule to return. Each time it costs me $250.00. Despite wearing a bite guard religiously at night my teeth have worn down and they tell me I need a $10,000.00 replacement. It has been less than 5 years! They were beautiful initially, but I have had to attend many gatherings and social events with missing teeth. This is not what I thought I was getting!

My late mother always paid on time after she passed 31/12/21. As executor received probate. Took over a year to sell the property which was vacant and cleared. Gave a final reading when sold. Power was turned off for the last 6-7 months. Gone from being in credit by a large amount to owing funds. Spoke to an agent who admitted to working from home. The agent was very patient and professional, But couldn't answer all my questions. Asked for a supervisor to call me back, just made excuses that it wasn't possible for a TM to call me. Issue still not resolved. I would never recommend this company to anyone.

I'll post this review as the trust pilot reviews are fraudulent and the negative ones just  ""disappear"";
Now trading as E.ON Next Energy Ltd but still the same old fraudsters.
Taken nearly 3 months to register a new build property that they then proceed to produce a ""statement"" with the wrong address(!) on it!.

One of the ""claimed"" electricity ""smart"" meter reading was wrong and had been made up. The estimates were so far out they may have well been on a ride with the green comet, they just make the figures up by plucking numbers out of the air.
The gas meter had not been even set up so they had to use ""estimates"".

Complete scam, shocking behaviour and typical of an energy supplier, an industry which is in serious need of the fraud squad investigating the whole squalid fraud against the consumer, from the energy suppliers through to the energy ombudsman.

If you have a choice - do not ever sign up with them, go elsewhere (but the choice is so limited now as they are all on this scam). EON are just like a parcel delivery company, they think a change of name will improve their reputation, but underneath it is the same crooks and incompetence running the show - remember they took over what was left of n-power, and they went bust because were so useless.

An update to the original review I had posted - one was a response from E.O.N. Next, making an accusation against me that I was a liar. That is a new unethical low that any company can sink to, but then they are an electricity supplier who's depths of depravity know no bounds - scandalous.

Secondly, EON have requested more information, else they ""may"" remove the review (on other words a method of artificially raising their trust pilot review profile by removing all negative feedback about them), yet it specifically states NOT to provide personal information when writing reviews). They already have the information about the customer, all they need to do is stop being fraudulent and start acting professionally by dealing with the issues that consumers and customers of them are raising instead of trying to sweep them under the carpet.

Useless company, tried to send a meter reading, but they still have an outdated phone number on their website! Shameful they haven't bothered to update this, it's not exactly a major project, just a few clicks on a keyboard at their end. Called the new number but it's only staffed for limited hours Mon-Fri so I tried the online help, but the 'Digital Energy Specialist' who was promised to help me was a web bot, going round in loops telling me to call the number on their website! Which is where I started. Useless bunch of amateurs and greedy cost cutting measures meaning customers getting a bum deal as usual. Shouldn't have to jump through hoops to provide a simple meter reading.

Eon installed my new boiler in june 2021 and has been leaking constantly predominantly in this winter again. They caused damage to the boiler during the installation and when I contacted them they asked me to contact the manufacturer. I contacted Bosch and they came to replace the piece that was damaged. They plan was when they conduct more than 2 repairs the boiler was going to be replaced but nothing like that happened. Now the boiler  is constantly leaking due to installation fault and when I contacted eon, all what they could say was for me to contact the local plumber to fix the boiler that their warranty was 1 year. The boiler was so expensive, I am still paying this on finance and yet still have to spend money through local plumbers. The whole experience is painful and I can't do anything about it. When I put a complaint, no body responded to my complaint. I have now put a bowl under the boiler and keep topping up the pressure whenever  it drops. I will not recommend eon to anyone for boiler installations

I wish I could give -3 like the temperature currently outside!! So far me and my 3 children have been left for 36 hours with no heating, no hot water and no way of using my gas cooker. Apparently we are not important enough for an engineer to come out!!
All because of a lost purse, which contained my gas card.
So after calling and spending over 2hrs on hold on the 'emergency line' as it was 7pm, I spoke to a representative who sent me on a wild goose chase with the wrong activation code for a new card. (First night no gas) 12hrs later (7am) I am back out with no luck and I get through to another representative, who informs me I have been given the wrong code AND the alternative card other than eon I was advised to get was also wrong. So I am given another code with 3 card options I could get. I finally find a EDF card, the activation code works (yay) but once home the card is NOT ACCEPTED! As again wrong information given. Speak to a 3rd person, told he will top up my metre manually while he sends me a card which will take 3 business days (this is friday) and to call back in 2hrs if gas is not on metre. Well he didn't check with me that my metre was not a smart metre, so of course after waiting another 3hrs still no gas! Call back again to find out I can no longer find a card myself for top up as they have now issued a card out. And because I wanted to speak to a manager the phone was put down on me! So my family have been left for another night, with no gas and no solution from anyone. At one point they said they would send an engineer to come and top my metre and give me a card....but now they have said that there is no record of this being said! I am honestly at breaking point as it is so cold. This is unbelievable, I will be going to my local news paper and my local mp.

Topped up our gas card yesterday but the meter says there's nothing on the card. 24 hours later, 8 phone calls, emergency last night told us to speak to day staff, rang them several times with them telling us different things and coincidentally apparently the last phone call cut off exactly 5pm! Hometime for them. 2 calls to emergency line after that, first guy couldn't have been more helpful and stayed on the line while we drove round several shops attempting to get it sorted, he even rang the fourth one to see if they could help, they seemed to think they could so we let him go. They couldn't so yet another call to emergency to get a useless woman who's answer to it was I'm sorry but you need to ring daytime. So far, 8 phone calls, most while we're supposed to be working taking up over 4 hours, about 2 hours driving between 6 shops and we still have no gas.

EON are a highly dysfunctional company with no right to operate. They are chasing a bill that I queried already with N Power and cannot seem to get it right. They keep calling and starting again without ever knowing what the previous person has told me. I can be on the phone for over an hour one day with them and the next day another one calls to start again, 'we work on an automated system' she said - nonsense! Why can't they communicate with each other? They always say they are looking into it for me and never get back to me. They have recognized that the bills are way too high and can't explain it but refuse to call back or sort anything out. I requested a deadlock letter which they sent but it was dated 8 months ago! They told me that they had sent it to me then but I never received anything. They guaranteed that the head of complaints resolutions would  call but of course not heard anything...

Eon is the worst electric company to have a licence to operate in this country and should be taken off them. I have a on going complaint from when Npower was in existence. I have put in so many complaints with Npower at the time and now with Eon from when they took over from Npower with a disputed bill and also from my account being opened before I moved in to my premises and billed for electricity that I have not used. Eon kept shouting my complaint without notification and any letter of reconciliation. Then came the debt collection agencies who quickly ran off when told what was going on as Eon never told them. I even had Eon's solicitor contact me when I told her what was going on they ran off. With being billed for electricity that I have not used and Eon sending debt collection agency to get money off me this is known as fraud. Since I have legally with held payments which in law you can do the bill is over 2000 pounds ( not my fault). Last week they broke the law by sending out a team to replace my meter to a payment meter forcing me to pay a disputed bill. The government legislation stayed if a bill is in dispute ( like mine) they can not disconnect battery power , which they did. They did not even come to the house door not even show my partner who after a call to see and ask what they were doing. No warrant shown no ID shown they just came turned power off disconnected meter - totally outside government legislation other words broke the law. This company and THE way they work needs to be investigated. The CEO office is now supposed to be looking in to the disputed bill and complaints but they never notified me to this but a member of staff who responded back to another trustpilot remark. No one from Eon is now responding to any emails sent to them regarding my complaints or getting this disputed bill resolved. If any shareholders read this you need to looking in to replacing the top management as they do not correspond to customers. Anyone looking at using it changing their supply to Eon stay well clear of them as they are dishonest, fraudsters and bullies.

i was with this  company for over 10 years , the bills just kept creeping up. i had the biggest shock when they said my monthly bills were going up to ¬£400 in may 2018. in the same month i had a bill saying i was in credit by ¬£3000. it didn't make any  sense because soon after i had another bill saying i owed them over ¬£1400....i was at my witts end at this  point, the stress and anguish was horrible. i phoned them numerous times and was always fobbed off with answers that didn't make sense. i finally left them in November 2020. At one point ,they had the nerve to cancel my direct debit without my consent and they blamed the bank ,saying it wasn't  them but to call my bank.
i am in the process of going through the energy ombudsman to see if they can look into this . i phoned to ask for an update with the Eomb today , and i was told that they have offered a letter of apology and a good will gesture of ¬£100, to which i kindly declined and the lady on the end of the phone couldn't have agreed more and they are going to investigate it further.

As a single parent and disabled with a disabled child. I am appalled that Npower suddenly hit me with a ¬£35,000 bill and refused to talk to me about it. I put in several complaints, all ignored. I contacted ombudsmen and they told ombudsmen to not get involved. and worst of all they wont talk to me and are now threatening to steal and  sell my house to get the money back!  there is obviously a problem, yet they wont look into it. They have wrong information and wont put it right. and as a single person in a 3 bed house, I cannot physically run up ¬£35,000 electric bill! I am at my wits end, they know I am disabled and all they did was send the bill in larger text which doesnt help or explain anything. This is discrimination against he disabled and against human rights. And to top it off they have blocked all my attempts to communicate with the CEO or try to approach anyone higher up in the company. Their entire attitude is ""You owe us, and we are taking the money one way or the other"" there is no care, understanding attempt to help? There is no acknowledgment they could be wrong and for a disabled person it just adds to the pain and stress I am already going through and makes things worse.

Few days later, I had a message thanking me that I've agreed to change my direct debit to ¬£111 and they have moved my pay date to 15th, even though my preferred date was 1st!! Can't get through on the phones, or the chat. I felt I had to cancel my direct debit, and I'll make a payment on the 1st, they will soon contact me when they realise their direct debit has failed.

Switched to N-Power Select as they were best priced.
However, priced low for a reason. 
You will never be contacted, you will never speak to customer services or a manager, you cannot get through on the phones and will also never be contacted once you've completed the 'website call me back service' . 

I'm astounded a company can be so poorly ran. Waiting for my contract to finish!

These people are fraudsters trying to charge me for electricity before I even move in the house and before the property was up for rental. They even opened an account in my name 3/4 months before I moved in; like I stated before the property was up for rental.  They now are refusing to talk to me as the bill is in dispute and they are also charging me for debt collectors who haven't been to the house. Yes even when there is an official complaint on going they still send the debt collects out. The solicitor I spoke to stated do not pay the bill until this is resolved as doing so means that you agree to the agreement and as such at the moment as there is a dispute in progress there are no agreements and as such NPower can not do anything. I have even told them to take me to court about 8 times - they refuse- wonder why???

Complete rip off! After being a customer with Npower for many years they decided to start charging me a ridiculous amount a month, triple to what I was paying previous even though I work 6 days per week and never had my heating on due to being in a flat it wasn‚Äôt needed. After ringing numerous times to discuss this, customer service couldn‚Äôt care less, took my complaint further and they still didn‚Äôt take it seriously. So I left and found about company who now charge me a much more reasonable monthly amount. Avoid!

Ive been with NPOWER for six years, and I can say they took a lot of money from us. They charged me 125pounds a month which we did not used much of our heater and electricity because we are working 4 days to 5 days a week from 8am to 8pm. When I moved in other house i switch to AVRO which is more reliable and cheap.

NPower are a failing business from a customer service point of view. 

My elderly relative received a communication from them to say she was over ¬£400 in credit, however when she gave her meter reading the credit amount disappeared. When I spoke to them on her behalf, I wasn't satisfied with the explanation for the billing and credit amounts. The person on the end of the phone was nice enough but there seems to be a marketing / business strategy problem in communicating the  6 month billing account that my mother in law was on. In my opinion, the account was not fair, they communicated a huge credit at the beginning of the period which was misleading especially for pensioners on low income.
Poor customer service and poor marketing and communication.
Don't waste your time, there are plenty of better suppliers to chose from. 
In my relative's words ""They are without doubt the worst company ever to deal with!""

Dreadful company. Been having trouble with them for 12 months. Estimating bills wrongly. Bllling me for gas when the meter was shut off in an empty property.Thought I had settled this in January then it starts again in June.Closed the account in June.Guess what another demand for ¬£30 appeared threatening to bill me for debt collectors and warrants for access. I don‚Äôt live at the property. There has been a new tenant since April

I am no longer a customer of theres and haven‚Äôt been for months. Yet they are demanding payment for gas I haven‚Äôt used from an address I do not live at.
Try to phone and you wait for an eternity. Phoned and requested a call back. Call back came and the call was dumped. They are now owned by Eon who are not much better

Consistently incompetent and made it so difficult for me to stop an unnecessary supply to my garage, as I could no longer own a car due to heart condition. Kept sending me bills, even though no electricity used and would not let me stop supply. I would never recommend  this company to anyone. They said they could remove the meter but I would have to wait outside the garage for the engineer to come and gave me a 4 hour window. I asked if the engineer could ring when he arrived as the garage is over a 100 metres from my house. They said that it wasn‚Äôt possible and I would have to wait outside. The stress made my heart condition worse. In the end I said that I was moving so could they stop the supply. They kept sending me bills telling me how much I owed them, I would pay it as it became too stressful to argue, but a couple of weeks later they would send me another one.
They then said the supply had ended, but I have now received a bill to the ‚Äònew occupier‚Äô for nearly ¬£30.00, even though no electricity is being used and I don‚Äôt want the supply. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any escape. It continues to be an ongoing nightmare. I have not been able to work due to high risk of covid and do not need these unnecessary bills, but no matter how long I wait on the phone to explain my situation, there is never any solution. I would give a ‚Äò0‚Äô star if I could!

If I could give a 0 Rating I would.
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. FOR YOUR OWN SANITY PLEASE STAY WELL AWAY. 
I remember reading these reviews last year and was very worried, but stupid me, listened to the Dishonest staff & got roped into a deal that was in fact not the deal I thought it was.

I was told that my payments would not significantly increase and if they did, they‚Äôd give me plenty of warning. 

When I received an email to say that my monthly DD has increased to ¬£94 I called NPower straight away to find out what the hell was happening. I live in a one bed flat on my own and so was shocked to see such an increase and also was told my payments were fixed.

After numerous telephone conversations with rude and very disrespectful staff, Every ally having to step by step instruct the agent on the phone on how to log a formal complaint, I was basically told that there should have been a mid year review, that they will not listen to my initial phone calls when I was sold the tariff and that they can do nothing about the monthly payments. Oh and told me I was in debt with them! 

This company won‚Äôt listen to a thing you say. They lied to me from the beginning & then think they can just apologise and that will be the end of it. They seem to not like logging official complaints too. When you do eventually get to log one after spending 3-5 hours on the phone. You will get a manager calling you to say they‚Äôll add ¬£10 credit. They also won‚Äôt tell you that the complaint regarding the miss-sell of the tariff was closed and so you have to then fight to get another one logged. The complaint handler will call you and say that there is nothing they can really do and try and fob you off. 

I was also told to call back with new metre readings to see what they can do and when I called back they said nothing because I had complained. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt understand how in 2020 in these highly regulated industry a company can get away with this sort of conduct. An independent government investigation really needs to be done on NPower as they cannot surely get away with this. If I went and took more money from someone‚Äôs bank account but told them initially that I‚Äôd only take a certain amount. I‚Äôd be done for a criminal offence. This is the same and just astounding how they are getting away with this.

Looks like I am not the only one who's had lousy, contradictory, and inefficient Service from nPower.  Yes, they have had Covid to mess with their operation, and staff have had to work from home, and the office in Hull was shut.  However, believe me, complaining gets you nowhere with this company and even when you make if an 'Official' complaint you may well end up as I have with a totally inept 'Decison' which just reinforces my dissatisfaction with them.  Most staff one talks to are very pleasant and claim to be trying to help, but one person tells you one thing and the next tells a different tale.
Utter inefficiency is how I would describe my experience with them and I CANNOT recommend that you consider them whatever the prices.

I have now presented this company with entirely accurate self-read meter readings 3 times. They continue to send the same estimated bill, which is inaccurate by about ¬£158. They have not actually carried out their legal obligation to read the meter themselves (about every 2 years), since by their own admission the last readings they did were about 9 years ago.

Takes ages to talk to anyone on the phone. When you do get through it is difficult to understand the person (May be asian) The person I spoke to gave me the impression he didn't care a jot about what I was saying and struggled to answer my questions. Poor impression of the company has made up my mind to leave. The company owe me money as I am in credit due to the incorrect estimate (By them) and instead of correcting this by making a repayment to me they  have reduced my payment to ¬£11/ month. They will also undated my tariff  in July but if I choose the cheapest tariff I have to pay ¬£60 cancellation fee to get out.There should never be a cancellation fee to end a term agreed between a customer and supplier as long as the customer has done nothing wrong.

My partner and I have Npower as our duel fuel suppliers. 
In late January 2020 we signed up to get a smart meter fitted and the first appointment was 11th February in the afternoon slot. I took time off of work and duly waited in. By 1900 I went on the assumption that they were not coming and called customer services. They told me that the engineer had run over on their appointments and wouldn't be attending that day. They said that the engineer should have contacted us to tell us but they hadn't. We were given ¬£30 credit and rebooked for 27th February and a slot between 1400-1600. Yet again, no one attended and no one called. I called Npower that evening andbyet again no real excuse or reason was given.
The customer services rep escalated this as a complaint.
Yesterday 3rd April I had an email from the complaints team apologising and still giving no explanation as to why twice i have had engineers fail to show up, also an explanation as to why it's nearly 6 weeks to give me a run of the mill dead pan email.
Understandably they are unable to book any further appointments so we are still no further forward with Npower. 
So, a warning, customer services folk are pretty good and do their jobs well, unfortunately the comlmaints team and engineers are a different kettle of fish. 
Poor poor service

Horrendous experience.  
After 7 months of having duel fuel from them I got an email saying ""sorry your leaving us"" etc.  I called to find out what was happening and was assured it wouldn't happen again.  I happened again and again.  I lodge a complaint and after investigation was told they have never supplied my gas and were accidentally supplying another home and were closing my gas account and unable to tell me who may be my supplier.  Email basically saying there's nothing we can do, we won't respond to further contact.  I have now also has a letter saying that my electric supply has swapped to NPOWER by mistake and they are swapping my back to my non-existent other supplier.  I'm worried my services are going to stop and the phone line has a message saying it is not taking calls.
I'm now switching and see if they have the gall to fine me for ending the contract early.  Fingers crossed I can do it before they completely balls up my supply!

We received a Government funded free boiler which was managed through NPower who were contracted to roll out this programme on behalf of the Government.  They used Dyson to fit the boiler.  We've recently had our floor up to renew it and discovered a water leak from when the boiler was fitted, where the condenser wasn't sealed properly.  NPower were not interested as it had been over a year since the boiler was fitted.  Had we not renewed the floor we would never have discovered it and the joist would have eventually rotted away.  Very disappointed with this attitude, given we put our faith in the engineers doing the job properly in the first place! Have taken a film of the whole leak, so unable to show the extent of the damage.

I use this company for gas and electricity for my business. Fitted a smart meter for my gas, been sending estimated bills.
What is the purpose of a smart meter ü§î.
I think the smart meter is faulty, due to a high gas bill. They want me to pay for the engineer to come out to check it, due to me queering my bills been very high. I own a small takeaway, they are saying am using around ¬£700 in gas a week, I don't think so ü§™.
Due to this, I have stopped the direct debit and they agreed until it is resolved.
It's been two months of calls to them, nothing done.
I have changed my bank account, as I informed them about it, just for electricity to come off only.
Looking at my bank account, they have taken part of the gas bill out off my account. This is classed as fraud, I didn't agree to this.
My bank is now investigating this, hope they are taking to court for this.

Definately not worth the one star, I would put none if I could.
Me and my partner were with NPower while we lived in Nottingham and the payments were extraordinary. We also once received a bill for ¬£300+ for electric which they could not justify but just kept telling us the information that was already on the bill, not explaining why our bill went up 10x in one month! 
Having recently moved to a new property, I was disheartened to find our that NPower was the current supplier for that house for gas and electric and so we had to put up with them supplying our gas and electric until our new supplier had finished switching us. It turns out that they charged us nearly ¬£70 for the 13 days that they were our supplier which is more than our monthly rate for our new supplier. With only two of us, it's been quite hard finding this extra money and their customer service are no help at all and just tell you things you already know. Please, do your research and go elsewhere.

This company is an absolute joke. I have spoken 5 times on the phone to them and wasted five hours. I ring this number and I wait, wait & wait. Half the staff don't know what they are doing. They give you a reference number. When I called the next time they could not find who I had spoken to. 
I closed my business three weeks ago and I told them in advance that this was happening. My final bill came as estimated bill ¬£126.41 so I called them; the accurate reading that should be less than that. The bill that came shocked me; one came to ¬£97.99 & another the one to ¬£454.52.
In between I got nine bills in a week; I own a little business! 
Last year i paid ¬£1092.78 so they put me on cheaper tariff & now I have to pay ¬£1657.13 this is absolutely joke.
So please be aware of this company. I will give them 0 rating but there is not any so I would say that they are terrible and I have lost a lot of money, with no help from the company.

They are a waste of space.  Firstly they were charging me for wrong meter in our shop.  Advised them of this and it took them 9 months to get it right.  Then they decided to increase direct debit to double what it was agreed at for no justifiable reason. 
Appalling customer service throughout contract. I've ended up taking them to ombudsman service on 4 occasions in the last nine months.  All complaints found in my favour.  After hours and hours of work.  They have refused to send call recordings after completing all their stupid procedures. 
STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BUSINESS AND SANITY. WORST SUPPLIER EVER

I have been with around 8 suppliers now for gas and electricity. All have been fair though switching regularly to get better deals. All has gone well until trying to leave npower through uswitch. I have never met such a poor set up not tailored the customers needs. I switched in April and was given a refund in early May of ¬£69 made directly to my bank. Fantastic! Time to spend! 10 September I receive an email telling me I owe them ¬£54!!! Why? I complained and asked for an explanation in writing and how I could repay over time. I got a letter saying by agreement with me the complaint had been closed. Untrue. No mention of a way to make affordable payments! I complained by phone - they wanted me to give them card details - I wanted to pay with some post dated cheques so I could keep account... no we can't do that. While I was on the phone (30mins plus - kept me waiting) the post arrived - dated two days after my complaint had been closed by them (without n my agreement) a letter demanding payment or my credit rating would be compromised! Poor, poor and worse than poor. I only gave a one star because it isn't possible to give less.

Up until recently I was a customer with Npower for over 3 years, the issue I had was my bills kept increasing yet my energy consumption was not.

I received my final bill and to say I was shocked was an understatement! ¬£346 due to my account being underestimated for over a year.

No meter readings taken by an engineer for this time period nor any prompts from Npower for me to undertake them, quite frankly my account was obviously not being monitored. I have stated this in my official complaint however to no avail. I am now taking the matter further especially given that upon speaking to an advisor it was clarified that my gas meter has not had an inspection since 2016 therefore falling short of what is outlined by ofgem regarding suppliers licences, namely metres must be inspected every 2 years at least unless other arrangements had been made. In my case this was not and therefore due to the lack of concern regarding this and the lack of interest to try and resolve the complaint raised by myself I have no choice but to take this further with myself also preparing to take my case to the Gas and Electricity Marketing Authority.

In addition to requesting all my statements showing the KW per hours used and the cost of the energy I have made a full subject data access request in addition to providing evidence of the metre inspection in 2016 and also the telephone recording from my conversation with the advisor regarding the matter. 

I must say I am disappointed that loyal customers can be treated like this and as a company you fall very short of what is expected in relation to customer care!!

Worst company ever! My Electricity meter stopped wot, for no reason. I still have electricity but the meter does not record how much I am using. Npower have said for the last 11
months that they have no appointments available for my area and so can not give me a new meter go the foreseeable future!!!  My electric bills are being estimated and I have been paying them. Don‚Äôt know if they are correct or not! N power said initially that due to this being their error, I would only be charged estimated bills, no more. So I told all my builders to charge their power tools, as I would only pay an estimated bill. Now n power are saying ... when (when ever that is) I get a new meter and faulty one removed , if they can collect data from the faulty meter, they can back date my bills to October 2019. Charging me the actual amount owed. I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but I do not know if I am owing more & more money every month or not. There‚Äôs no way to tell. Without a working meter. To make matters worse. Npower have not given me my latest gas bill. They said that as I‚Äôm dual fuel and my electric account is being looked into, it means they have to freeze my gas account too. So I no longer get a gas bill. I am ¬£429 in credit and they have refused to give my money back as my accounts are frozen. I have changed suppliers today. But don‚Äôt know if npower will let me switch. s no one knows if I‚Äôm in debt or credit.  Whatever it costs I‚Äôm not staying with npower. Take them to court if they prevent me switching.

Fuming is not the word and I am not even a customer - nor will I EVER be.  My mother in her 70's closed her account as we found her a better deal.  To bring her account to a close she had to pay you a remaining ¬£100 ‚Äì you then proceeded on the 6th August to take ¬£1,584 out.  She has been battling and chasing it since and still no sign of the money.  Yesterday after being on hold a total of two hours over two calls I had to leave work and go to her house as she was in floods of tears - totally devastated by the constant messing around.  We then had to drive her to her bank so she could to an indemnity claim.  Assured by Npower that this would mean the money would be back in her account by 6pm last night yet STILL nothing.  I will be taking this to social media, local press and contacting anywhere else so I can bring this company to its knees as this is an absolute disgrace.  We have had to loan her money for bills and food which she has hated and none of this is her doing.  You took the money in error which I could almost accept but to still have it after 23 days is tantamount to theft.  If I can transfer funds in a day then why can‚Äôt you??

Fraudsters......they overcharge on their estimated gas bills and then credit the original invoices and re-raise new ones. They take payment for the new invoices and do not repay the credit, if you do not realise you lose the money as you have to request a repayment. Disgusted.....bet they make a fortune out of this practice.

Minus a million..........the only star I would award these. Without doubt the worst provider of customer service ever!!!!!!!!!!!

10 years plus of constant nightmare and aggravation, the list of my complaints and their horrendous gaffes is endless.

Here is a few:

'Gas is a Luxury'...yes several years ago after having gas fitted an Advisor told me due to issues with my billing...

and the problems I have had continue to happen.

The last several weeks due to issues with a DD and my bill being in debt by ¬£800.00, despite me trying to arrange a new DD payment and Installment plan, I was met with this is now unavailable and basically if I did not accept this a court warrant would be issued to enable pre-payment meters to be installed. 

Several days ago I contacted Npower and made a ¬£500.00 payment and it was agreed that I would be able to sort a new DD payment plus Installment Plan. However due to an issue with my card was unable to precede with my payment, so actioned this via my bank.

I was informed the appointment for pre-paymnet meters was cancelled.

and I would receive a phone call several days later (once payment had been met).

Today 14/08/19 I contacted them as I had not had a call, after being directed to another department which appears to be the common thing, I was then informed the arranged pre-payment meters would still be installed and nothing was cancelled. Also again THREATENED with a court order/warrant if I did not agree to this.

Despite me explaining to the Advisor of what had been said/agreed last week, but as usual...no matter who you talk to every employee of Npower seem to do one thing and say another. 

Moving forward she got my rant...12 years of being tied to these hideous greedy bastards!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I informed her she stick the smart meter, pre-payment appointments up her arse!!!!!!!!! And I will precede to make a further payment to clear the debt and happily stick two fingers up to Npower forever!!!!!!!!

Seeking another provider now for the next fun...surely most cannot be as bad as Npower....only time will tell????

My sister died suddenly and in the midst of all the pain, grief and sadness that came with her passing I had to deal with npower. How come everybody else offers you a human voice as soon as you say bereavement - but not npower. It took me around 10 phone calls, approximately 1 1/2 hours on the phone and I was still stuck with an auto voice. I eventually logged a complaint and was rewarded with a human voice that said there shouldn't be a problem just phone in the final readings to us. So off we go again with the same auto voice and the same problems. More time wasting so now I have to waste even more valuable time with an online chat to get someone to ring me for the readings. End result i get a final bill - I am okay with that as it represents what my sister owed - but then my phone company advise me that I have spent ¬£10 on npower's chargeable (only) phone number. That annoys me!
I've neve used npower and I am sure that after this fiasco I never will. Their customer service system is diabolical.

I am currently in the middle of taking Npower to the Ombudsman. I rented a property in 2015 for 4 months which turned out to be an illegal let from the Landlord. I never had any bill in my name and left when the landlord actually admitted the property did not legally exist. The shop downstairs actually had the gas and electric accounts. 

Fast forward 4 years, I receive a debt collector letter from Wescot demanding ¬£1k for gas - something i actually had none of whatsoever in my property which make the situation even more laughable.

Where do I start with the different angles of disgust I wish to portray regarding Npower and Wescot?

July 2015 ‚Äì I agreed a tenancy in good faith on what I believed to be a legal property n Manchester, I was subsequently let out of the tenancy early following a serious number of failures from the landlord. I took the property hastily as I was extremely vulnerable following the swift breakdown of a marriage. The estate agent acted as only an introducer, and they were likewise unaware of the fact the prpoperty did not legally exist.. 

On the Wescot letter ‚Äì there is no ‚Äúsupply start date‚Äù and no ‚Äúsupply end date‚Äù ‚Äì very questionable. How can they search me, and correspond with me in such a manner - demanding money and yet not even telling me the period it is for? 

Secondly ‚Äì Disconnection date 9th May 2019? I left the property November 2015 ‚Äì and I did not owe a penny to a single company ‚Äì period. I have never had any correspondence from Npower and left the second I found out about questionable situations ‚Äì owing not a penny to anybody. I had found out via a local solicitor, Manchester City Council, and land registry information that the landlord had failed to separate the downstairs shop from the upstairs flat in the required manor (which Manchester City Council confirmed to me at the time). The shop and flat were therefore running on the same gas, electricity and water via their downstairs account. I had no control over anything. 

Once it was brought to my attention that the Gas, electric, water, fire safety and various other legal aspects were falling short of the required conditions needed to let the property (and that I had clearly been taken advantage of), I sought help and advice from Citizens advice and Shelter simultaneously. Hence how/why I left and found proper accommodation.

The Landlord admitted failings, and allowed me out of the tenancy only 4 months in, even giving me my deposit back early and without an inspection such was his liability. In that time, I was never at any point made aware of any charges. 

The best part about this situation ‚Äì I never at any point used any gas All usage from the shop downstairs.I had no access to any. 

I have since found out that NPower allowed the landlord to call behind my back - and set up an account in my name (without telling me) - for a property which does not even exist.

Even still - coming at me after 4 years breaks back billing rules which they have failed to even acknowledge.

This has led me to get a mark on my credit file. They claim to have neutralised this however at the time i was applying for finance and it cost me this. 

The stress of receiving this when my partner is 3 weeks from giving birth is frankly disgusting. 

They offered me ¬£100 compensation with is frankly pathetic. 

They claim to have investigated fully and are sending me a final latter - yet i still have no idea........

1. The landlord opened an account in my name. I mystery shopped therm and its clear that meter readings are needed, obviously property address, telephone number, email, name etc. So how can they have even set this up?

2. How come they had no supply start date, if they had opening meter readings? What were these readings? their own website to this day does not acknoledge existence of the property

3. If he supplied my contact details, how come nobody telephoned me or wrote to me during my entire time at the property and beyond?

I have emailed All the company seniors including Paul Coffey, Chris Thewlis, they just ignore you and fob you off with a stock reply claiming to have fully investigated despite me having absolutely no answers. 

I will go to the ombudsman to tick boxes (as i fully expect the usual bias towards the big boys) before progressing further.

How they get away with the stress caused and the bullying tactics is beyond me. They are a risk to people in society

I am on a campaign to let pople understand what thery are dealing with with NPower - very dodgy dealings.

The stress and upset they cause with no remorse is incredible. The fact they are literally unnacountable to anoyone makes it easy to get away with consistently.

OMG what a rip off
OMG what a rip off. I opened a new industrial unit for my business and the existing supplier was Npower. So I gave them a ring to take over the gas and electric at the new unit. I hadn`t had a chance to shop around, as we were so busy with the move and everything. I gave Npower a call and asked for the best deal they could do for me for both the gas and electric. I explained I was calling blind and I trusted the guy to give me a great deal, big mistake!!! A few days later Green Energy Consultant rang about my new Industrial energy unit supply. I explained I had gone with Npower, they asked what I was paying for gas and electric. OMG the lady nearly fell off her chair!! Gas Standing charge 78p a day and 6.7p per KWH, Electric 0.2413 standing charge, day rate 28p per KWH. I had no idea as I had trusted the Npower guy to give me a good deal, which he completely took advantage of. With the help of Green Energy Consultant I lodged a complaint, as I had told the Npower sales guy on three occasions during the recorded telephone conversation, I wanted the very best deal, which he said he had given me, but clearly he gave me the worst deal!! After threatening to go to the Ombudsman. They agreed a new deal which was: Gas standing charge down from 78p to 24p per day and KWH down from 6.7p to 4.31p. Electric KWH day rate down from 28p to 18.1p, Night rate down from 22.6p to 12.7p
I am sure that these are still not the best prices but they are very much better. Lucky I only took the contract for 1 year and believe me after that I will never ever use Npower again....
Beware these people will try to rip you off, do not trust them avoid at all costs. I was lucky that I found out just in time and have learned a valuable lesson. Do they not realise that operating in this manner is alienating their customers? This is bad business Npower you need to stop this practice. I had rang Npower direct, this was not though a third party, this was their own sales team. Very Poor!!!

Money grubbing, full-on thieving scum.
This lot of thieving jokers get one star - only because the rating system won't let you do zero stars...
We started off with a what turned out to be too good to be true dual fuel tariff that they then changed after a period without informing us. I understand that companies can change prices after your tariff has run its course but I was under the impression that they need to inform you that you need to review your price plan. They bumped us up onto whatever goddamned extortionate plan they had dreamed up after a hefty cheese orientated meal and proceeded to send us way, WAY over the top bills. We never saw itemised bills nor were we ever visited by a meter reader despite repeated requests. They were adamant that their ""estimates"" were indeed accurate.
Due to an unforeseen period of illness and other knock-on effects and circumstances, we were unable to keep up with their demands for payment and we were subsequently threatened with all sorts of legal actions. We took advice from the CAB who estimated that they were charging us for a household of ten or more and were we running an indoor dope farm or something? 
There are TWO of us in a one-bedroom flat!
We took our case to the energy ombudsman who told us that N Power had a right to review our claim which would have to be done by them within a certain time frame, fair enough... 
In the meantime, they took the opportunity to sneak into court behind our backs and obtain a court order to have meters installed by their pet mercenary scumbag enforcers who do not give a toss about pending cases, only immediate profit. 
We were now on their highest tariff and had to pay off the ""debt"" as we topped up the meters. We have paid off the arrears and were still on the meters when they gave us the option of charging us about ¬£300 combined to take out the meters and ""rehabilitate"" us. We told them where to go after some pigs anus laughed at us down the phone after telling us that there was a fee for leaving and ""that it was in very small print for a reason ha! ha! "" We stuck with the meters because despite being on the highest tariff we were still paying about TWO THIRDS less than they used to charge us with their so-called estimates. We have now gone with another company so we will see how that pans out.
In summary, I found N Power to be rude. incompetent, contemptuous and bordering on the criminal in their dealings with customers. They rely on the fact that most people cannot afford to take them to court while employing tactics like court enforcement despite breaking legal rules and regulations themselves.
I hope the owners of N Power and anybody that works for them go to the 13th pit of hell.

Update 24/04/2019... We are now paying about ¬£10 a week for electricity consistently and slightly less for gas with a company called ""E"" on a smart meter, we have worked out that N Power was charging us over ¬£54 a week before they forced a meter on us, yep! that's right, ¬£54 A WEEK! Big difference!

THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!

My tenants moved out and closed their gas and electric accounts. When I moved back in I had no idea who their provider was, so I decided to go with British Gas. 

British Gas opened a gas account for me without any problems. But they told me that the couldn't do the same with the electricity as Npower had put a block on the transfer due to an outstanding debt of ¬£55.

I had never dealt with Npower before, I had neither positive nor negative views about them. Since it was only ¬£55 I decided not to challenge this and pay up. I wanted to have only one provider for gas and electricity and I had chosen British Gas, almost by flipping a coin to decide between the two.

Then the nightmare started. 

Npower told me they had to open an account in my name to settle the debt, but only after I had phoned them over 4 times. Each call followed the same format: A menu to navigate, and by trial and error I found the options needed to speak to a person. Then came the very long wait times, in one call I waited 40 minutes someone spoke to me. The agents were polite and understanding, but I was given conflicting information on each occasion. Each call lasted at least an hour. I also texted their agents, who were clueless, they simply read through pre-prepared scripts.

After a month Npower STILL had not issued a bill, but I got almost daily emails telling me how wonderful they were and the outstanding amount kept changing. By now I was ground down by Npower, arriving home tired out at 7:00 PM, I just couldn't face yet another tussle with Npower, so in a chat I threw in the towel and said I'd stay with them. Imagine my gobsmacked fury when she texted back ""Welcome to Npower, we hope you have a wonderful experience with us""!!!

In the end the final bill for ¬£55 arrived, I paid it, and they released me to British Gas.

In all my life I have never ever had such appalling service from any company. I will never go back to Npower under any circumstances.

Npower has deservedly been receiving bad reviews for years but they don't seem to give a damn. It's high time the government made such disgraceful practices illegal.

Absolutely awful company.  

We left Npower because they were overcharging me for gas and electricity.  After leaving them we received a final demand letter from them for over ¬£200.  It basically said 'pay up or we are passing the debt to a collection company. 

As we were in credit when leaving Npower, I failed to see how there could be a debt.  

Made a complaint and then received a phone call saying we had no option but to pay, if we did not then a debt collection company would collect on Npowers behalf. 

Three months down the line, and hours of phone calls and emails later. 

Turns we owed nothing to Npower at all.  

They are blaming our new supplier for, apparently. giving them the wrong information.' Npower cancelled the debt we never owed‚Ä¶ as a gesture of good will!

Npower caused us lots of stress and upset during the 3 months.  

Their final response‚Ä¶ Take it up with the Ombudsman. 

All I can say is, please read all the reviews on here before making your mind up if you‚Äôre thinking of switching to Npower.  Companies do not get bad ratings for nothing, and Npower have more than most.

Horrible customer service, and a cowboy amateur company. Changed direct debit details with them over the phone as they do not allow it online on their app or website. I see that a bill went from paid to rejected, i called up customer service who said it was set up with the correct details the bank rejected it. I spent 1 hour explaining to them the regulations and rules or direct debits and laws in this country. Then they asked if any confirmation was sent when it was changed and i said no you have no sent anything. They then didn‚Äôt know what to do and said i have to go into the bank to allow it. I explained again how direct debits work. They are absolutely clueless. I contacted my bank and they said they have never had npower try to set up a direct or take payment which is probably why it was rejected as they have not set up anything. I called again on Saturday and after re explaining everything, the lady hung up on me. Disgusting customer service! I will be leaving this company asap, they have gone against their agreed contract as well as not following the regulations. They are trying to tell me to pay cash and i have informed them that i will not until they have solved the issue and actually stick to the terms they agree. Direct debit is set in place to prevent manual payments! What a cowboy company!

NPower executive complaint reference number: Reference URN-101830848

Absolutely irresponsible and arrogant customer care department :
My account was closed is 2012 even after 7 years I have no refund or resolution. Benefits being a Npower customer :

1. Disclosure of personal information to debt recovery agency even though Npower owed me a refund plus nuisance calls from debt recovery.

2. The refund never issued. A customer care executive explained they provided to charity :)

3. Charged me based on a wrong meter. Numerous trouble to get it corrected. Once corrected they never refunded the excess I paid.

4. transferred the account 2 or 3 times to a different supplier without my permission.

5. Each time they update their IT system you get a new account number with some random name on the account.

The list is long. Initially I placed 4 sites with Npower (one they already supplied). They failed to register the sites. When chased it took some time to get them registered. I raised 2 complaints which failed to have any effect. When I then complained on their website I was contacted within 30 minutes. This time things started to happen, though the person I dealt with showed limited empathy and insisted on going through all the same checks everytime we spoke despite the many months of debate we had. 

However they then set the contracts up to align with the dates they had registered them NOT the date on the legally binding contract. Once again it took some time and some convincing that this is what they should do. 

Agreeing compensation for the fact that the customer was on out of contract rates for many months due to their failure took ages. 

Now the bills make absolutely no sense because they have gone through a number of cancel rebill processes. And in some cases are over 60 pages long despite these being really simple nHH meters. 

I have recently been promised a statement of account to help me understand the bills but this has not been forthcoming. 

All in all this has been a disaster. the culture of Npower seems to be one of never admitting responsibility or liabilty irrespective the clarity of the error. The general tone of conversation generally lacks any empathy again despite the facts. Accessing Npower is likewise very difficult, long hold times, excessive security, no notable records held of previous discussions so each time you start again.  I have resisted taking this approach for over a year but can resist no longer.

If i could give a zero star, i would. 
Will not go into my situation but very similar to every other comment on here, they make up bills, threaten to send debt collectors, wont take my proof of 'photo' showing readings. Have tried to deal with them 8 times over about my issues, getting no-where every time. I give up. I will never use npower again.

Awful company! I was loyal for over 13 years (never missed a bill). I then moved house and had confirmation I had paid in full and closed the account! 6 months after I moved out I get harassed for more money for my previous address that I don‚Äôt own/live at any more. N Power say they‚Äôve made a mistake and forgot to add up my bill correctly (even though I was on a smart metre) and it‚Äôs taken them 6 months to realise?! I called up and explained my situation to be told I had to pay it due to someone at Npower making a mistake! They put me on hold so I could speak to a manager and then hung up on me. It might be a coincidence but it happen right before they closed at 8pm :(

If I could give NPower less than 1 star I would. Worst customer service I have ever received. I have been overcharged for the last 6 months (my bills suddenly doubled after years of being a customer), they have caused me financial difficulty, are not doing anything to help, I've told them to take me to court as they wont be getting another penny from me, the robbing b******s.

Absolutely disgusting service!! Put our direct debit up and charged us a huge bill on top as apparently we were using a lot more electric through the winter. Swallowed this bill until they then told us it was going up again and we had another ¬£300 to pay on top of our direct debit payments. Sent a statement through which makes no sense at all and passed around to all different people who didn‚Äôt have a clue what they were saying. Was put on hold for long wait times after being on the phone nearly an hour to then have the message of the office is now closed and the phone cut off on me. I will never use NPOWER again and seriously don‚Äôt know how these people are still in business. You are absolute thieves and rob people of everything they have. Counting down the days for my contract to end. Didn‚Äôt realise how many awful reviews this company had and so wish I had seen this before I signed up. Please don‚Äôt make the mistake we did and take your money elsewhere as these people do not have a clue about customer service and will take everything you have.

Appalling customer service, including the complaints department. Amounts billed each month are all over the place, even when on a direct debit and the bills are queried - only to be hit with a huge final bill when switching (and then another one 9 months later as they claim the first one was incorrect!). The worst energy company I have ever dealt with.

Avoid Npower like the plague - 1 star is far too generous for these clowns. I switched my account from Npower in November last year - it's now mid April and I'm still waiting for the refund of overpaid direct debits. ¬£89 taken in overpayments may not be a lot to Npower but it's a lot to me. At least 4 times Customer 'services' (lol) have promised the refund is being processed. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.  Now I've just been told they are sending a cheque rather than refunding back into the bank account they sucked the money out of in the first place. So, if this cheque ever appears, it's a trip to the Bank and a 4-working-day wait for the cheque to clear.  You couldn't make it up.  One of the biggest mistakes I've made in recent years was to sign up with Npower - DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID

I still don‚Äôt see how I owe this bill as my new provider is charging a lot less and no under payment, every time I‚Äôve tried to call them to sort it they have pasted me from pilar to post. It‚Äôs nearly been a year since I left and the issue is still on going. I have now given up chasing it and am going to pay but I keep getting red letters and they won‚Äôt set up a direct debit. It‚Äôs like there purposely trying to make it difficult for customers. I can safely say I will never is them again.

Found out last August 2018 n power had blocked me from switching without reason and had me on a hyper inflated tarrif, in order to save around ¬£2300.00 i had to take a new contract with them on a lower rate. which they are charging me more than they quoted. its now March 2019 and not resolved my case handler craig wardrobe is always away and wont call me back they know its made me feel suicidal and dont care, i went to the Ombudsman he found them guilty on several counts and sent them his request at resolving this issue so far they deny it, and used it as a means of saying they cannot talk to me about anything they are still screwing me and wont tell me whats going on! Why isnt there a body of law that can tackle this kind of criminality. Ombudsman has obviously worked in their favor. im still locked in and waiting for them to call and let me go elsewhere like the Ombudsman requested.

Do not use N power. Move to them as they offered the lowest deal. I provided them with invoice from previous energy supplier. They set the direct debit at ¬£75 month. A year on receive a final reminder to pay ¬£550 why estimate at ¬£75 when it should be ¬£120 a month be careful signing up.

I have never had a problem with Npower n relation to their delivery of fuel or with meters or meter readings.  However, I have recently had two issues with them which I've complained about and have to say I find their customer service and the way they deal with complaints is very poor.

The first complaint was about an agreement they made about the issuing of bills to my wife who has authority to manage my account. As regards this, several shortfalls in customer service occurred -
1  In error they stopped issuing bills to my wife
2 After correcting the error, they again stopped issuing bills to my wife without my consent.
3 After receiving an acknowledgment of my complaint sayig they would respond within 7 days, they did not respond.  I only received a response 7 days after submitting a further 2 complaints.
4 The responding complaints handler claimed no bills had ever been issued to my wife and closed the complaint without my agreement.
5 After complaining yet again Npower stated they HAD restored their agreement about the issuing of bills,  but they hadn't.

These shortfalls were actually identified by the energy ombudsman after I referred the issue to them.

The second complaint was in relation to direct debit payments.  when renewing my tariff with them.  The following shirtfalls I belive happened are -
1  Based on meter readings, they quoted me a monthly payment ¬£1 less than I had been paying which persuaded me to sdtay woth them.
2 Two  months later they invreased my payments by 30% saying that my current level of payment would not cover increased usage during the winter months.
3  Three months later, without my consent they gave me a refund as I was in credit, presumably therefore, paying too much.  They did not reduce the payments.
4  I response to my complaint about this they stated thst the monthly payments WOULD remain as they were otherwise I would fall into ""debt"" over the winter months.  Ths complaint was again closed without my consent.
5  Some time later I complained again about this and have never received a response to this complaint.
6  When asking if I could pay by standing order rather than direct debit so that I could have some control over my payments I was told that I could do so if I wished.  However, a ¬£90 per year discount is given for paying  by direct debit, but not for standing order.

Overall Npower conducts some aspects of its business according to its own rules.  They refuse to change these as per customer;s preferences, stating that they are a matter of policy or ""business decisions"".  They refuse to give access to these and they are not stated in their terms or conditions.  They offer no explanation of the errors they make and offer no assurances about the likelihood of errors recurring.
The energy ombudsman service, Ofgem actually supports them in this.

Disrespectful, department blaming, rotten company

If I could put 0 stars I would, terrible company with terrible customer service. Would discourage anyone from using. 

Had two meter changes booked and no one turned up and was never notified. 2 days off work and not so much as a phone call to tell me that an engineer would not be arriving. Sat in a freezing house until 8pm after calling three times throughout the day to check if the engineer was coming only to be told each time ‚Äòit‚Äôs booked and he would arrive‚Äô. 

Utterly terrible service especially in both instances, and the fact that NO ONE would have told me that an engineer was not arriving is just disrespectful and terrible beyond customer service. This company is rotten at the core and I hope customers stand up for being treated like this.

All this while this my account is being handled by a complaint manager after previous issues.

Never ever will I use npower again.

Terrible - gouge direct debits ever-higher (despite my regular meter readings showing a growing gulf between my actual energy readings and their fantasy), assuring me that everything would be squared when I changed supplier. More than two months later, they are holding several hundred pounds and no reply at all to my multiple attempts to get clarification. Don't forget, they confirm they owe me this money ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN SYSTEM! Spent an hour waiting to speak to a lobotomised call centre moron, who said (and I quote), ""I don't know anything"" and ""We can't change our system"".

Don't touch them with a bargepole. I had a prepayment meter, moved out of a property with money still on the meter, and received a bill after one month because supposedly I hadn't send the meter reading, and the outstanding balance on the prepayment meter doesn't count!


Thankfully I now live in a property without prepayment meter and supplied by another supplier.

avoid this company in all costs, I moved to my new property and the previous owner was using Npower.  I was out of gas for 2 months because I didn't have top up card for pre-paid gas meter. I rung Npower more than 10 times with request to send me new card. First they said I can pick up the card from given address of the shops when i went there they didn't have any and it was waste of journey. Than I asked Npower to send me the new card but they never send me.  Eventually I had enough of them and switched to British Gas. When I switched to British Gas, Npower started to harass me by sending letter and calling me and asked to pay the previous owner debts. I made complains 5 times over the phone, each time they denied saying they never received any calls from. It's very badly managed company and in total mess!

The most incompetent company I have ever dealt with. The actually made more mistakes than I thought was even possible. Here's what happened:

1. In May I moved into a house, phoned the national meter line who said npower supplied the house.

2. Gave npower my opening reading and immediately requested a switch to another supply who were cheaper.

3. In June Npower tried to stop me moving to another supplier, when I asked why they said somebody in the office had requested that supply was switched from npower to npower which blocked my move to another company. Phoned up and they said they would sort it out.

4. In July I tried again to move to another supplier and they blocked it again saying I was in the process of moving to npower. Never once did I ask to switch to npower, I gave them my opening reading out of courtesy because they already supplier the property.

5. In August I wrote a complaint with all this info, they took 5 weeks to respond with a phone call to tell me everything was sorted.

6. In October I get a letter saying they are going to take direct debits from November from my account yet I haven't had a supply with them and I haven't had a bill so I don't owe them any money.

7. I put in a GDPR subject access request in July and they ignored it. To embarrassed to show me what data they hold.

A complaint is now going to the ombudsman for the energy supply and to the ICO for ignoring the DSAR request.

Below is an open letter I sent to Npower today. Needless to say they‚Äôre awful.

Dear Npower,
 
RE: How to treat your customers
 
I am writing this letter to you whilst sat in my house with your Engineer. He's a lovely guy, he is. A credit to your business (GO NPOWER!). He came here to check out my (possible)
my faulty meter, which in the last month, has seen me experience an increase to my electricity bill of 50%.
 
The meter didn't show any apparent fault and so to help me keep an eye on my electricity usage and also try to spot where the fault is coming from, a smart meter was
recommended. I was all for this as I'd already been told, incidentally, by someone who worked for you that we would be a great match for a smart meter (check your
call records).
 
He's now been here 2 hours and we've achieved zilch. Nada. Nowt. Well, hang on that's not fair. We have achieved something. We (collective sense), have wasted our time
and resources and you've also managed to really 'F' me off.
 
To cut a 120 minute story short, (I say short, it hasn't felt like it, especially whilst you're trying to entertain two under 5 year olds). I had an Engineer in my
house who was ready and able to fit the Smart Meter which was sat in his van on my drive, however, the powers that be would not rubber stamp the installation. The reason being?
I'm not eligible.
 
Cue ringing you (yup, whilst the engineer was in my house) and being on hold for 25 minutes. Did I mention I had two young kids to entertain too? Fortunately,
they chose the optimum time to poo in the toilet and also fill a nappy. I like to think of it as a physical reflection of my day. #livingthedream
 
Inbetween cleaning poo, throwing random bits of buttered toast their way and just allowing my eldest to climb out of the living room window (groundfloor...),
I got through to you! I explain and I'm told 'no'. Cue hold again. I'm then told that I can have one but I couldn't possibly have one today. Wait for it - you're
gonna like this bit! I NEED AN APPOINTMENT! Yup. I need to book for Engineer to come to my house. Oh the irony.
 
So, through gritted teeth the appointment is made. Oh wait, hang on. You then realise you need to cancel this appointment? Was it because you had an epiphany moment realising that this was, quite frankly, bonkers. Alas not. I'm told that I'm incorrectly registered on your database as being on a two rate
meter. You need to update the system before you can make me an appointment and that's gonna take about a week to do. Then I'll be able to make an appointment to
book an Engineer to install the smart meter (#letsjustforgetabouttheengineerinmydrivewithoneinhiscarnowbecausethatwouldbestooooooooopid) (FYI - this ""#"" is a representation of how I feel as your customer.)
 
Oh, one more thing. I just wanted to extract your Core Values from your website. Titled ""npower Critical Behaviours""
 
1. Customer First, ""Getting it right for our customers"" - CHECK
2. Driving Performance, ""Delivering on our promises"" - CHECK
3. Focus, ""Prioritising where time and resources are spent"" - CHECK
 
There's a couple more.
 
4. Challenge, ""Improving the outcome by giving and receiving ideas""
5. Accountability, ""Giving and taking responsibility for our actions""
 
I'm looking forward to seeing how you achieve the last two.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Just one of your worthless customers

It took them months to finally send me a bill but that was not correct, over the next couple of months I received nearly 15 different bills and threatening letters. I then managed to speak to someone who apparently gave me the correct amount to pay, once paid I was told the acccount was closed. A month later more and more bills started to come again. In all I received well over 20 bills, 10 different amounts to pay and also affected my credit rating. I have sent this to the energy ombudsman to help try and sort out. Resolution was disappointing, ¬£75 rebate and a letter of apology.

The most shambolic company I have ever had the misfortune  to deal with.
Even the seemingly simple matter of setting up a new tariff has been beyond this company .To add insult to injury I also received a letter saying that they has looked into recent bills which were "" incorrect"" and they would be sending a further bill - even though I had paid in full every quarter. I have now received the additional bill comprising of approx. 29 pages -  and the sum requested  was  1Penny  !   Avoid. Avoid.

Why do you have to award a star when no star is warranted. Npower must be the worst energy company that's ever existed. Their customer service dept is as much good as a chocolate fire guard. I've complained about the same issue for very nearly 2 years and nothing as changed. This is definitely the worst company I've ever had to deal with. It's never their fault but they're always sorry, easily said but in my opinion not meant.

As I said ...... 1‚òÜ is far above what they're entitled to, which I could award NO STAR.

Npower are crooks and charlatans. They sign you up to a reasonably priced tariff and after a month or so they more than double it and rip you off mercilessly. I think this is their business model. Get new customers,rip then off until they have enough and leave,and repeat. I advise everyone to stay away.  I live in a one bedroom flat and my monthly cost went from ¬£40 to ¬£100 a month. Considering a never use the electric heating and use minimal appliances it's blatant theft. For contrast OVO energy now charge me ¬£45 a month and I'm not overusing energy of going above my tariff. Do yourself a favor. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.

Check your bills!

I live alone in a one bed flat out all day and my direct debits were ¬£80 a month and constantly owing them money! I went through all my bills and my monthly energy usage costs I found that my bills did not match the cost of usage I was using and they were clearly plucking a random higher figure our the air so I was overpaying and STILL saying I owed money

Never again... do not use them

The worst company I have ever used! They couldn‚Äôt ever take my accounts over, even though they told me they did! This left me with a bill of ¬£500 from another company. 

They agreed to compensate ¬£425, (this was never paid) 

I was on the phone for many many hours, they now ignore my calls and have been waiting 8 months for a final response and they haven‚Äôt bothered. 

Extremely unethical company and I would avoid them! They are also very expensive. 

There customer service is poor, and takes hours just to get through on the phone! And when you do get there they can‚Äôt resolve anything. 

Their resolutions mean nothing as they do carry out their very on resolutions.

Rang with final meter reading, Npower totally ignored and issued a bill for more usage then we use in a whole year.  Rang again, gave actual reading again, was told that a new bill will be issued.  Now two weeks later have received a red letter demanding payment for the original overstated amount or they will cut us off!! Rang again to be told that the billing department hadn't updated the reading!  Completely incompetent customer service, it is an absolute joke.  This has been on going since April, we are now at the end of June.

Disgraceful customer service and billing process! As a result of Npower calculating my bill incorrectly they led me to believe I had credit on my account which I decided to take out of the account to then be told 3 months later that I actually owed them money! Then when I left the company I was not informed how much my final bill was and when it would be taken. Ended up with 7 formal complaints on my account when I left, and was told that I would get money taken off my final bill as a result, but that never ended up happening. Avoid this company at all costs!!!

Absolutely shocking company. You can't get through to them on the phone. Every time I tried to get through it was a minimum of a 45 - 60 minute wait. I wanted to set up a manageable payment plan but couldn't get hold of anyone meanwhile I keep on receiving threatening letters telling me they would take me to court. I also wanted to question the amount they were charging me as it didn't seem correct but couldn't get hold of anyone. Please do not go with Npower.

Npower had over ¬£675 in credit which I asked to be refunded. After being told 3 times it would be refunded they didnt because the gas meter had been fauklty and not giving a reading. Npower knew that it was faulty and did nothing about it until they were asked to fit smart meters.
They then refused to rrefund the credit because they were going to average usage and charge first.
They knew the meter was faulty for a few months so in my opinion its their problem and should have moved to correct it as a matter of urgency not held onto my money so they could take a cut to cover unmetered usage.
Distugting.

Been on the phone for an accumulative time of more 5 hours (and still on hold). First they told me I need my own electrician to get rid of the old meter (so illegally snip off the security tag on the old meter) then has taken a ridiculous amount of time to just book the appointment for their own team to change the meter. p.s still on hold due to a problem with their diary system....

Please contact me if you have issues with Npower: legal@danemarkspubcompany.co.uk

I think enough is enough with this company and we need to stop them making peoples lives miserable.

my issue:
On Monday the 22nd of January 2018, Npower instructed bailiffs to cut power off in Popular bar, Face 11, Cathays Terrace, Cardiff. This was because of an outstanding debt from a previous tenant. Although they knew this and new the new tenants had previous contacted them to transfer the energy, they never transferred it over to the new tenants and never notified them of this. The new tenants even showed and sent them the lease agreement and other documentation to prove we were new occupants. They first tried to make me pay the debt of the previous customer, when I refused, they then proceeded to disconnect the energy supply.

 

After disconnected them causing me and my partner multiple losses both direct and indirect, they then sent them the following email requesting thousands of pounds to reinstate the energy (Email):

As per my email attached and our conversations this morning.

 

We needed to carry out a credit check to determine whether we would need the new occupier, All Lyn Ltd, to pay a security deposit. Following on from this check it was necessary for us to request a security deposit. As discussed this would amount to ¬£1,819 also we require a re-connection fee of ¬£115, so therefore the total amount to pay would be ¬£1,934. The security deposit does not include the bills, we ask customers to pay 4 months' worth of consumption up front. 

 

This calculation as I advised earlier is based upon the estimated annual consumption (EAC) for the property (the EAC is 19,042 so 4 months or a third of this is 6347) and our deemed rates which is currently 28.66p per KW/h. I have yet to make the necessary changes to the account and bill up the 2 parties that we discussed earlier. However we will require payment of the accounts prior to us allowing the supply to leave.

 

Also as I advised earlier I have provisionally booked a job for 1 February 2018 between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm to reconnect the supply. However should payment of the above security and re-connection fee not be received by 4:00 pm on 31 January 2018 I will cancel the appointment. You advised me that you were to get another supplier to take over the supply from us and ask that they re-connect the supply for you. Can you please advise me if this is the case as I will need to cancel the appointment that I have booked?

 

Just for clarification I am willing to allow the supply to leave as things stand now, i.e. no payment of the security deposit and no payment of the bills, however we will not re-connect the supply. If you require us to re-connect the supply and then leave we need you to pay ¬£1,934 prior to re-connection and then to pay the bills in full prior to transferring to another supplier.

 

The reason we were keen on using Npower was because of the commitment of the CEO Paul Coffey released on the first page of website in attached PDF Treating Business Customers Fairly otherwise, we would have changed suppliers.

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs vitally important to me that we don‚Äôt just follow the Standards of Conduct for business energy suppliers set out by the regulator, but that we keep to the standards you, our customers, would expect. That‚Äôs why throughout the year we have been looking at how we can improve and do better, making sure we invest in the systems that will provide the service you expect from your energy supplier. And also, that our people are able to give really good service day in day out. Getting it right doesn‚Äôt happen automatically. That‚Äôs why as my executive colleagues and I spend time with the people across npower who serve our business customers, we are keen to make sure they have the procedures and policies in place to not only deliver the service that Ofgem requires from us, but also that best supports your business. This is a constant focus, so let‚Äôs take a look at what we‚Äôve been doing in 2016 to deliver even better service and show you how we‚Äôve delivered on our promises. Setting our standards Paul Coffey, npower CEO‚Äù

 

The owners cannot trade without energy and believe the knowing that there were new tenants in the premises, rejected them to hold their business to ransom for nothing other than greed.

Overview; We took over the supply at a property after evicting a tenant. We needed gas and electric in order to complete repair and refurbishment works. NPower sent out or sent us to collect FIVE cards over the period of one month. NONE of which reset the meter. Looks like they were trying to get us to pay off the tenant's debt. For every ¬£1 we put in the meter we got approximately 30p in gas. ¬£46.00 for 5 units of gas at the coldest time of the year. They REFUSED to send anyone out to the property to check or reset the meter. We eventually signed up with a new supplier after we lost a proposed tenant for the property.

Absolutely USELESS !

Dealing with Npower's telephone team - when you can get through!
Background
14 December 2017
Rang and registered with Npower. The customer services contact advised me to pick up a gas prepayment card [note: Card#1] from the local NISA shop, give them a code, get the shopkeeper to remove the card from the machine, then to purchase at least ‚Ç§1.00 credit [note: I put ‚Ç§5.00], then go to the property and put the card in the meter. This would reset the meter ready for us to use whilst working on the property. I followed the above instructions to the letter. The meter did not reset. I returned to my office and called Npower again. They said they would send out a card with the reset information on it and to put it in to the meter and leave it for a few minutes to transfer the information and reset the meter.

19 December 2017
Card arrives [note: Card#2]. I go to the property and put the card in the meter, nothing happens. Debt remains. I ring Npower again. Another card will be sent. The letter which arrived with Card#2 has a prepaid envelope and the letter says to return any old cards, so I return Card#1.

20 December 2017
Another card arrives. [note: Card#3]. I go to the property and put the card in the meter, nothing happens. Debt remains. I have other jobs to deal with and the contractor is not starting until 01 January, so I don't follow it up again until the beginning of the new year.

04 January 2018
I put ‚Ç§20.00 on the card. I put it in the meter. It said ‚Ç§6.00 for gas, ‚Ç§14.00 for debt.
09 January 2018
I put another ‚Ç§20.00 on the card. I put it in the meter. It said ‚Ç§6.00 for gas, ‚Ç§14.00 for debt. I speak to Npower customer services. They send me to NISA shop with a code to pick up a new card [note: Card#4]. Same routine, new card, input code, remove card, reinsert card, put on ‚Ç§1.00 credit, go to property, insert card in meter. Lo and behold the meter credits with the ‚Ç§1.00..... debt remains. Meter gives me ‚Ç§0.30 for gas and takes ‚Ç§0.70 for debt.

.... over to Npower's social media team....
11 January 18:38
Me Hi. I am currently having a big problem with Npower and seem to be wasting my time running around in circles due to your incompetent staff.
In December [note: 14th] I contacted Npower to take over the gas and electricity at one of the properties we manage. It had become vacant and it needs work before it can be relet.
I was advised to go to a local shop, pick up a gas card, give the shopkeeper a reference number for them to put it to set the card, get the shopkeeper to remove the card, then request at least ‚Ç§1.00 credit, I put ‚Ç§5.00 on it. I did everything in the order I was advised. I then drove back to the property, put the card in to the meter and left it for about 5 minutes. I was told it would reset the meter so that I was not paying the previous users debt.
Fine, or so I thought.
I then put ‚Ç§20.00 on the card at the beginning of the month. I put it in the meter. It said ‚Ç§6.00 for gas, ‚Ç§14.00 for debt.
The same a couple of days later. ‚Ç§45.00 so far and only been able to use a couple of units of gas!
I rang Npower again late on Tuesday afternoon. I was advised to return to the shop again, in at least two hours time. I said that I would probably return to the shop the following day as it was late now and I finish work before the two hours is up.
This morning I went to the shop. I did exactly as I was asked. I put ‚Ç§1.00 on the card. I then took the card to the property and put it in the meter. ‚Ç§0.70 debt. ‚Ç§0.30 gas. It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t reset the meter.
So now I have paid out ‚Ç§46.00 and spent three or four hours either on the phone or running between various shops and the property. The contractors have been delayed in starting their work as the property is too cold for the paint to dry.
I want this matter sorting out. Npower service is dire.
How much gas have I got for ‚Ç§46.00? Less than 5 units!

Npower We're sorry to hear of your experience, Symon :-( Please send us the address details in a private message and we'll be happy to help. ^Vicky

11 January 18:38
Me Hi Vicky. Account number #account number# address #address# (I think its ###) Account name #account name# (my business name as I am employed to oversee the works)

Npower Hi Simon, thanks for your message. For security, please confirm the email address, which fuels are supplied by Npower and if your authorised to discuss the account? ^Vicky

Me Hmm not sure I gave you an email address, if I did it was either #@#.com or #@#.com. You supply both gas and electric. We haven't had any problems with the electric so far. I am the sole person with authorisation.

Npower Thanks, Symon
First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to you for the shortfalls in customer service you've experienced from Npower.
Would you like me to arrange for a new command to be sent to your local shop or for a new card to be sent through the post?
Also, please confirm the total amount of debt remaining on the meter and the amount of credit lost in the meter? ^Vicky

Me is that the ""27 GD Remaining"" setting? If so it says ‚Ç§#debt amount# ! Other settings on the meter include ""24 GD Rec Rate 70%"" ""23 GAR 30%"" ""7 Standing chg 0.2750"" ""10 tariff cost 3.335"" I wrote all these down when I was at the property earlier Please send me a card. I'm getting nowhere with returning to the shop over and over. Although I've already picked one card up and been sent two others, so I remain sceptical that this is going to work!
I believe I gave you my office address for correspondence when I spoke to the woman on Tuesday

Npower I'll call our Prepayment Team tomorrow to arrange for a new card to be sent to you and let you know when this has been completed. ^Vicky

Me thank you

Npower You're very welcome, Symon and I'll speak to you again tomorrow. ^Vicky

12 January 10:37
Npower Morning Symon, hope you're well. I've called our Prepayment Team who have arranged for a new Gas card to be sent to you by special delivery to #address## and this will arrive by 1pm tomorrow. [note: Card#X] I can confirm the new card will clear the previous occupier's debt from the meter, however this will not will give you the credit back which you have paid. Please send me a message when the new card arrives and I'll be happy to work out of the extra you've paid and arrange for this amount to be sent to the meter. ^Vicky

Me Ok. Thank you. I worked out that with standing charge from inception to now and the use of 5 (five) units of gas it should have cost about ‚Ç§7-‚Ç§8. Does that sound about right?

Npower I'll arrange for your bill to be produced to show your actual usage once the new card has cleared the balance. ^Vicky

15 January 10:09
Npower Morning Symon, hope you've had a good weekend. Please confirm if you've received the new Gas card and if this has cleared the balance on the meter? ^Vicky

15 January 12:43
Me I went the office at #office address# on Saturday. I also popped to the property. No card. Also been to both this morning. Still no card. So much for the special delivery by 1pm!

15 January 14:42
Npower I'm sorry to hear the card has not arrived, Symon
I've contacted our Prepayment Team who have advised the card has been sent, however there has been a delay and this will arrive by Wednesday. [note: Is she saying Card#X was never sent or are Npower sending out another card? Card#Y]
Please send me a message when the key arrives to let me know the meter has been reset. ^Vicky

17 January 12:11
Npower Hi Symon, hope you're well. Please confirm if you've received the new Gas card? ^Vicky

Me No card..... running out of patience here. Lost over a week with contractor already.

Npower I'm sorry to hear this, Symon
Please confirm if the post has arrived today? ^Vicky

Me My post arrived at 9.15am as normal. Nothing from Npower. I think you need to send someone out pretty sharpish

17 January 14:06
Npower I'm sorry I'm unable to send an engineer to the property
I've called our Prepayment Team who has advised there is still a delay in sending the Npower Gas cards.
You can wait for the new card to arrive through the post or you can pick up a new card after 2 hours at: Nisa, 306 Broad Lane, LS13 2NN using reference number: ######.
Which option is best for you? ^Vicky

Me The card at the Nisa shop is preferred but the last two you have sent me to collect havent worked so i have no confidence that this will. If this card does not work i will be terminating with Npower and registering with a reliable supplier

18 January 10:01
Npower Morning Symon, did you manage to pick up the new card at the shop and is this working ok? ^Vicky
Me Got card [Note: Card#5]. Gave the shopkeeper. RTI declined. Card does not reset meter. I will ring #alt supplier1# or #alt supplier2# when i get back to the office as your company does not wish to sort it out. Over one month now and you wont send anyone out.

Npower I'm sorry to hear you feel this way, Symon
Please be advised that an engineer can not attend the property as there is no fault on the meter.
I've raised a complaint for you under reference number: 101654673 and the Social Media Team will deal with your account until this matter is fully resolved.
Would you like me to arrange for a new card to be sent through the post or try again with another reference number? ^Vicky

Me We have had FIVE cards now. I am not prepared to waste anymore time with Npower. There obviously is a fault somewhere. I am on hold to energy ombudsman now

Npower I can confirm the Energy Ombudsman will allow us 56 days to resolve this matter. ^Vicky
[note: according to ombudsman the 56 days would start from my initial call regarding the first non-working card on 14th December]

19 January 12:02
Npower Hi Symon, please confirm if you would like a new card to be sent through the post or to be picked up at your local shop? ^Vicky

19 January 15:42
Me We are going to work on a different property while we move the gas and electric for this property to #supplier#. I will be taking electric and gas readings, for transfer and account end, in the morning when i am back in leeds

20 January 09:07
Npower Morning Symon, please be advised that the change of supplier process takes around 19 days which means that your new supplier will contact you to request the meter readings when the supply is due to transfer over to them. Would you like me to help to have your meter reset or are you happy to wait until your supply leaves Npower? ^Vicky

Me You blatantly refused to send someone to reset the meter. We have had FIVE gas cards which have not reset the meter like you said they would. How are you proposing to reset the meter? Magic?

Npower Please confirm if the 5 cards where picked up from the shop sent through the post or both? ^Vicky

20 January 10:46
Me Two in post in December. Two from shop in January. One from shop 14 December
December shop pick up was first. Didnt reset so cards posted to me. They didnt work. Then the two you told me to pick up. This doesnt include the ones you said you were posting that never arrived

20 January 12:56
Npower I'll contact our Prepayment Team on Monday to ask for the best way to resolve this matter for you and let you know the outcome. ^Vicky

22 January 14:49
Npower Hi Symon, sorry for the delay. I've called our Prepayment Team who have advised that a new card is required to reset the meter and an appointment can not be booked for an engineer to visit the property. They have arranged for a new card to be sent to you and this will arrive within the next 1 to 2 days. Please send me a message when the new card has arrived and confirm if the meter has been reset. ^Vicky

24 January 09:35
Npower Morning Symon, please confirm if you've received the new Gas card? ^Vicky

Me Nothing in post from Npower again

Npower Has your post arrived today? ^Vicky
MeYes. Mail from TSB, Makro, Toolstation, Leeds City Council.... nothing from Npower
NpowerI'm sorry about this, Symon
I'll call our Prepayment Team again and come back to you soon. ^Vicky
NpowerI've called our Prepayment Team who have advised the new card will arrive by 1pm tomorrow. Please be advised that you need to register your new card in the meter and then go to Nisa, 306 Broad Lane, Leeds, LS13 2NW, top up the card with ‚Ç§1.00 and then put this back in the meter to clear the balance. Could you please send me a message tomorrow to confirm if the new card has arrived. ^Vicky

25 January 09:43
Me No card again. Am I surprised? No. You work for a company that does not do as they say and blatantly LIES to their customers.
[note: registered both gas and electricity with OVO/Boost who advise me that the supply should be transferred within a couple of weeks. Until then Npower will get nothing more. Once the property is changed to OVO the next tenants are more likely to remain with OVO rather than return to Npower

The Cards
Card#1 - picked up from NISA 14th December, Broad Lane, LS13 - did not reset meter
Card#2 - sent from Npower - did not reset meter
Card#3 - sent from Npower - did not reset meter
Card#4 - picked up from NISA 9th January - did not reset meter
Card#X - card never arrived, may never have been sent
Card#Y - may be Card#X or a replacement for Card#X but either way it never arrived either
Card#5 - picked up from NISA 18th January - did not reset meter

We moved to npower last January after a disastrous time with another of the big5. All went well and we received a bill in April showing we owed some money which didn't alarm me as it was the winter quarter . However that was our only bill until I got in touch with them for the ridiculous amounts our usage against others was showing and the astronomical amount they were asking for future direct debits. 
I can't praise their staff in billing enough. A complaint was issued and after talking for a while it emerged they thought we had an old meter and not a new one which measures gas differently so hence the outrageous amounts we owed!
Another person rang me the next day and by the end of that day; after several phone calls from our complaint overseer; our account was sorted and they actually owed us a refund which hopefully will be in our bank by the end of the week. 
5 out of 5 for speed in resolving the problem
1 star deducted for the worker who failed to see our meter was measured in cubic metres when he initially surveyed them.

Since I have switched to nPower, I have got lot of issue with billings and over payment. They hardly give me refund back. I ended up switching my contract with them last year. they forcefully switched my contract early, so they can charge me more for my bills. As new contract with charging me higher tariff, which worked in their favour.

Their customer service is nightmare. If I ask them about  A, they answer me about Q.


It is utmost greedy company, they have absolutely no respect for customer or practice any ethical / moral business practices. Its like Money is their GOD

They charged me extra money - ¬£165 , which landlord was supposed to pay. When I spoken to the customer service, they do not listen and be super rude. I wasted 2 hours over phone and they did not help. Told me that money is charged now, get it back from landlord. I had left the property two months ago, There service is the worst service one can ever have!! 
Never choose them for any of the services. They are the worst supplier one can have!!! Customer service should be rated negative - less then zero!!! Super rude people over the phone.......

We switched from Npower years ago and have to say it was one of our better choices. Our parents on the other hand have been loyal customers for over 15 years and are currently being treated appallingly. At the end of 2017 they were told they were in debt for over ¬£700 even though they have yearly meter readings, have always paid by Direct Debit (""DD"") and have been asked by Npower on several occasions to lower said DD. After complaining numerous times and Npower being unable to show my parents what fuel they are being charged for Npower are trying to increase the DD payments to ¬£197 per month for a one bed bungalow. 
Disgusting. Much better suppliers out there. Avoid at all cost!!

I switched to them for a years fixed rate tariff ending Dec 2017 paying ¬£71 a month. In August they credited me ¬£40. I logged in to find out why to discover that the they had increased my monthly payment to ¬£90, even though my fixed rate didn't end for 3 months AND they'd just credited me. I phoned to complain that I had not been notified of the increase and what was the reason for the increase. They said I was notified because it was on the website. A company this large should said an email, who logs on every week to check their account? How can they increase payments when it's fixed for a year? Why credit me back as well?

I moved to a house in July 2015 , the house was empty for about a year and needed modernisation. in all this time nobody leaved at the house so no gas was used.
all work was finished and at this time i discover that the property had pay as you go gas meter. I wanted to check the boiler and there was no gas. while checking the meter I noticed that there was a debt shoeing on it so i contacted npower  and they told me that in order for me to get the gas supply I to go to a shop to pay for the outstanding balance and add some more credit. at this time i was also advised to close the account because the house was going to be rented. at this point they opened a new account for the property ""to the occupier""   this is the conversation that I sent to npower: I was asked to provide a tenancy agreement to show that on the 17/08/16 when the payment was made to extinguish the standing charges to date accumulated on the account:182127969 that was closed on 15/08/16. the payments show to have gone to mr A Pxxxxxxxx acc no:xxxxxx463, a occ the occupier account also was issued and a ¬£85.37 credit letter was sent on 06/12/16
but the credit cant be claimed as it has a different account, this is a pay as you go meter and unless the debit is paid you cant get the gas. As soon as I got the unexpected bill for ¬£44.31 on 6/01/16 I contacted several times npower explaining the situation I was made feel like a thief trying to make someone else pay for my bills, the next bell changed to ¬£ 115.36, and the final one is ¬£85.36, by coincidence 1p different from the credit issued to the occupier account. I was told that my account was investigated and found that I did not pay, I'm baffled by the fact that there is 1 address & 1 meter allocated to it that clearly shows the debit was paid on the 17/08/16. so npower passed the matter  moorcroft debt recovery,  in July 2017, after they received the evidence they told me that they would get back to npower, I've today today received a letter from debt managers (services)ltd..... npower please take me to court!!!!!

One  of the worst experiences in my life. I was in a constant debt because no one was informing me that I'm using more than my tariff includes. I was being put on tariff for ¬£98 instead of ¬£67 and I was reassured that this tariff will cover everything including my debt. After 3 months  I've come to a final bill with ¬£107 in debt. They had no problems with taking the money of me every single month, however it seems that it's some mystical problem to tell your customers that they're going over. Also, customer service is terrible, give these people some training.

N Power have been overcharging me for my energy consumption as long as I have been with them, I asked them to fit a smart meter so I could monitor my usage and they responded with 'by law we have to fit all customers with one by 2020, therefore you will receive one by then'.... in other words no!
Therefore I decided to move supplier, this is when the trouble started! they sent me a final bill of around ¬£350, this was based on 'estimated' meter readings therefore I entered the 'actual' meter readings (which were lower) on to my online account, the amount owed then went up to around ¬£420! I called them to query this and they insisted this was correct and I must pay this amount immediately or they would stop my switch, I received numerous emails each day telling me to pay the outstanding balance, I didn't pay this amount therefore they stopped my switch! after numerous complaints we came to the conclusion I owe them ¬£50 so I paid this and the switch continued. 
The following month I received another final bill in which I owed them ¬£181! I queried this and they insisted it was correct as it was generated from my 'actual' meter readings, after weeks of emails and phone calls and threats of taking the complaint further with an outside organisation today they have informed me that the actual final bill is ¬£6 and the readings were 'estimated' hence the huge over charge. If I had of paid all these amounts when they were demanding forcefully I would be hugely out of pocket now and in debt, there is no explanation what so from N Power other than 'as a gesture of good will' they are adding ¬£6 to my account to write off the final bill. I have been with my new supplier around 14 days and have already had a smart meter fitted...............

""Utterly shocking levels of incompetence.... I have had bills with incorrect account numbers, bills cancelled and recharged randomly. 
So far we are three years down the line from the date the accounts should have been closed and I am still receiving incorrect bills.
Npower and the Ombudsamn seem to have no interest in giving me the information needed to verify the bills they are sending are correct. 

 Avoid them like the plague, they genuinely seem to have no idea what is going on or how to bill accurately and hope that persistence will wear you down and that you will give in and pay the bill regardless of whether it was owed or not.  ""

They totally messed up the change of contract from Scottish power.
Within about  month of the contract commencing they sent me a letter threatening  to break into my house, by applying to the court for a ruling to allow  them to force entry and they would then charge me for the cost of the court order. This was because I had repeatedly refused to allow then access to my meter to allow safety checks to be carried out. When I asked them how I could have repeatedly refuse them access when I had only been contracted to then for such a short period they told me they had repeatedly requested access the previous year. When I told them that I did not have a contract with them the previous year, they told me that the requests were probably made to the the previous occupier of the property. When I told them that I had owned the property for 8 years I got no response.   With about 3 months they imposed a standing charge on my bill,  when one of the primary reasons I switched to them was to avoid a standing charge.   After about 6 months I switched supplier to Ebico. Twelve months later NPower sent me an invoice  stating that they had miscalculated my bill some 15 month previously. When I asked for details I was told it was because they had a computer error 15 months ago. I stated that if I buy a car I do not expect the garage to visit me some 15 months later and ask for more money as they had undercharged me initially. N power stated that I had not told them the initial meter readings when I commenced the contract with them, when asked how they ever managed to calculate the bills I was sent they said they used estimated readings, when asked what these readings were they could not tell me as there had been some confusion.    I told them I would write to all of the consumer magazines I  knew and publicize my experience ie  the fact they threaten to break into my house etc etc.  Then I was telephoned and offered about 30 quid as a gesture of good will if I did not attempt to publicize the facts. I said that I had a social and moral responsibility to protect others from an organisation such as N power.  The money was increased to about ¬£80.
I then received a surprise parcel containing wine and a scarf, which was delivered to a neighbor,  that I had had previous problems with , causing me further anxiety.  Additionally, 
  a gift of wine wine to a teetotaller is of no value, plus I suspected it may have been laced with God knows what.
Do not do any business with this company as like me you will regret it for a very very long time. Plus no one believes  your story,   but I swear this is the truth .   YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

Never had a contract with this vile disorganisation as I signed with a proper company, EBICO, but npower illegally fitted (no Court Warrant as required by Law) prepayment meters to my home when I was out at work. The Law states they cannot be fitted where a genuine dispute exists and where a disabled person is put at risk by any loss of energy supply e.g. no heating where cold agitates a medical condition etc, thus making npower‚Äôs actions illegal. 
So this evil company just fitted these illegal meters anyway.
The illegal electric meter was stolen Sunday night 2nd April and npower refused to restore the supply until 4th April so the house had no electric for almost 2 full days.  I went to their offices where they very nicely threatened myself with the police when I instructed them to restore the supply which the Law states must be done within 3 hours where a disabled person lives. They 100% refused to make any arrangement to restore the supply or provide temporary heating, lighting & cooking facilities as Regulations require if power is not restored within 3 hours; so it‚Äôs just npower living down to it‚Äôs reputation yet again as the worst company in the UK for now the 7th year running.
Phoned their call centre and after a 26 minute wait, got through to a useless person that refused to put a manager on unless I admitted having an account with them (I never had or will). The person refused to arrange to restore the supply, get Northern Powergrid to come out & make the exposed wires safe, or arrange temporary heating etc as the LAW REQUIRES.
Phoned them the day after and finally they sent someone who arrived at 8:05 p.m. with another illegal elec prepayment meter. BTW, the Citizens Advice disability help section contacted npower last month stating the meters were illegal but npower just ignored them. So par for the course again for npower that believes itself above the Law and just carries on with Criminal Damage etc (smashed the meter door cover off) leaving exposed electrics to get soaked in the rain. Oh, and the illegal gas prepayment meter was fitted with loose connections that leaked gas when the ON/OFF valve was opened. Then there was the first illegal elec prepayment meter they fitted January 2016 that shorted out frequently and was a fire hazard that npower totally refused to remove until they knew the Health & Safety Executive had been informed about it.
There is a lot more but this latest update is enough for the time being.
Is‚Äônt npower wonderful.

Appuling costumer service and awful value for money. On two occasions we have been lied too by two different members of staff! On the first occasion we gave meter readings when asked, on the second meter reading the computer system their end automatically changed our reading without informing us. We was made aware of this when we received a letter stating we was in over ¬£700 worth of debt. We was promised we could never get in debt with them again as we was now on a payment plan and giving monthly readings. After many issues and upset we chose to change supplier. While the switch was taking place I contacted npower to make sure all was up to date which we was informed all is well and up to date. After chasing up out final bill we have now been informed we have another debt of ¬£353.

This all started back in April 2014 when I was between jobs and hit a hard patch financially, and asked for my account to be frozen just for a month, which they did (I'd been a loyal customer for 10 years, never defaulted in payments). I phoned them a month later to ask for it to be reinstated, and that's when the troubles all started. Every time they tried to set up the DD, they did it incorrectly and it was rejected. I was back and forth between Npower and my bank, every month, trying to sort it out. Each time my bank gave 'Idiot's Guide To Setting Up Direct Debit Correctly', which I constantly passed on to Npower. Every single phone call, they assured me it was 'all done'. This went on for over a year, then I started making manual payments. I then got really fed up with it all and demanded to raise a complaint. From then on I was told not to make any more payments until it had been resolved. This continued for another 6 months or so, each time my monthly payment was increasing, to cover the previous failure. Then I heard nothing from them for about 6 months, and then letters arrived to say everything was fine... 'relax' (their key word-makes my blood boil). They started the process of trying to set up the DD again, and off it all went again...rejected...phone calls... etc. Last April I though, enough is enough with the constant phone calls, because I had no tracking of what was going on, and I was constantly told conflicting advice and information from the (quite often rude) advisers. I requested that all communication be by email only. I demanded to take the complaint higher, as my debt was increasing to a ridiculous amount, and it went to 'Executive Complaints'. But no matter how much I told them how angry I was, how much stress this was causing me, all they were interested in was setting up the DD. Eventually, in December 2016, they finally did what my bank had been telling them to do (cancel down the old account and reference number, and set up a brand new account, with a new reference number~not rocket science is it..), and my first DD payment came out on January 2nd. But guess what? No payment came out for February, and Npower emailed me yesterday to say the Direct Debit was cancelled (by whom??), so back to square one.. I have also received the standard letters telling me I need to pay outstanding balance of ¬£2,100. They don't care one bit. All the times I wanted to make payments, give them up to date meter readings, them telling me not to because there was a complaint investigation. Well, they're a multi million pound company who doesn't give a damn about us as people.I have now passed this to Citizens Advice Bureau, and just praying that I will get a good outcome, and close this horrible experience for good. Why are they still allowed to trade, with so many bad reviews? Check out their Facebook page too. I haven't seen anything positive about them at all.

I wouldn't even give them one star! Absolutely shocking company. Takes 40 minutes plus to get through on the phone!   They charged me from 14th December- 27th December for my final bill yet I had moved out of the property on the 19th December! So they have charged me for 8 days that I wasn't even there for!!! Absolute joke.   I would not recommend these to anyone!!!

Npower created a dual fuel account on my property in a false name and when I complained the wouldn't discuss as I was not the named account holder. They misled the ombudsman and admitted they had supplied another person with my personal data. They said I had supplied meter reads so they must be accurate, in fact their bills clearly stated they were Npower estimates. They expected me to pay the charges on the false account and just changed the account name to mine thus compromising my rights under the data protection act. I have now reported them to the information commissioner's office for breaches of the DPA 1998. A truly appalling company which does not deserve to be in business, Was the most complained about energy supply to the ombudsman in 2014 and 2015 with an average of almost 300 new complaints a WEEK.

Our problems have been going on for 4 years now. Firstly, they got us to switch by fraudulent claims about usage. Then our bills were sky high and we questioned this. Then the bills stopped and they demanded over ¬£3000 from us!! We had heating engineers out who said our meter may be faulty. This was endorsed by the national grid. N power more or less forcibly removed our meter and claimed it was OK!! Yet our recent own readings prove we are using almost less gas than we were before. Each time we ring them we are lied to. At one stage they requested the number of the new meter which I had already sent off. The operative demanded I give it to her and, as I have arthritis I couldn't get up off the floor again. My husband is registered disabled and they really don't seem to care that they are pushing us to the brink by their lack of organisation and fictitious bills. Meanwhile, we can't migrate as until I'm well enough to write to the Ombudsman they say we still owe them money. WORST energy supplier EVER!

I used to have an ordinary quarterly bill with N Power, but they kept getting my bill wrong which reached a peak when they nearly gave me a breakdown by sending me a bill for ¬£5,000 for a one bedroom apartment. No that isn't a typo, it's five thousand Pounds for a quarter. Then on the phone they tried to blame me for not taking a reading, so I couldn't take any more and asked them to put in a pre paid meter. I didn't know the government were about to fine them for doing similar things to other people.
Then one day I tried to top up the meter in the only shop near me with a pay point, and it didn't work. The key had been deprogrammed for some reason.

N Power told me all I had to do was go back to the shop after an hour with the key and number they gave me on the phone and it would be reprogrammed, so I went to the shop and they said they didn't know how to do anything else than top it up.

I phoned N Power back and as the phone line would be closed soon and my electricity had gone off I said it didn't work and could they tell me where I can pick up a new key as it might be easier than what they said before not working. However they told me that I should go to another shop miles away to still get the key reprogrammed and that shop would be open until 11pm. I said that I think there's a shop 8 miles away who do new N Power keys that's open until late and I can drive there, but they said they didn't know any places further than 5 miles away. Then she was blaming me for letting the meter run out, so that brought back memories of when they tried to blame me for sending me a bill of ¬£5,000.
I went to the shop in the village they told me was open until 11pm but it had closed at 6 and I still didn't have any electricity.
I sat in my car crying at the thought of not having any power and it was going to be below freezing that night. As a last desperate attempt I thought maybe I would go back to the first shop and try again, but it still didn't work to reprogramme the key with the number N Power gave me.
Then I got the manger of the shop who said I could use a key they keep for another company and use the number to programme a new key, as I asked N Power in the first place to do but they told me not to get a new key and reprogramme the old one instead. So after hours I managed to get a new key thanks to the shop manager knowing what N Power didn't.
I only changed to a meter because I thought it would save me from the useless customer service being cocky and blaming me for their own faults. Yet even with a meter they're useless.I think it's about time I changed company.

Plus even with a meter when they send me a summery of payments it says I owe them money with a pay slip, and when I phoned to enquire what that means, they say it always says people owe money on a meter when they don't.

Firstly i never signed for my contact, the word yes on the phone tied me into a contract, they have never seen my signature on a form, i had 5 letters threatening to cut me off if i didnt switch after i said the word yes on the phone, and more threatening letters after they cancelled my direct debt for no reason and then blamed me, this happened twice, complaining to them is pointless as no one will listen to you and what they say goes, if i could rate lower than 1 out of 5 i would, 0/5 would be my answer after the way i was treated

Npower takes huge payments directly out of my account!!!

I live in a small flat in london and dont use much energy at all. I have done meter readings and they show I use about ¬£30 worth of energy a month. 

Npower and I therefore agreed to set up a direct debit charging me ¬£30 a month. All of a sudden, I get bills of ¬£151!!! 

This is much more than I use. I spoke to Npower, they apologized, and reduced the direct debit again to ¬£30. I however had to go through hazzles with my bank to get the funds back.

A couple of month later, Npower again takes out a huge payment of my account -- ¬£148!!

I cant believe this is happening! I have agreed to a direct debit of ¬£30, and Npower is abusing its privileges and rights by -- without warning and justification, increasing their payments.

I warn anyone who reads this to check your Npower bills carefully. This is in my opinion unethical, highly unprofessional and borderline fraud!

DO NOT USE NPOWER IF YOU EXPECT TO BE PROVIDED WITH GAS OR ANY LEVEL OF SERVICE. I cannot warn people away enough.

I am now left with no heating or hot water in 1 degree frost and have no idea when this will be resolved, as my myriad complaints and requests for assistance on twitter, facebook and npower's own complaints form result in replies days later that make no sense and do not help at all. When you then reply to clarify what on earth to do, you have to wait another two days for reply. Which again does not help or makes no sense. I have never encountered such appalling service at any company in any industry in all of my 35 years.

I will be transferring to another supplier asap. Unfortunately this can take a couple of weeks so will be left with an uninhabitable home through 2-3 weeks of winter. Perhaps I should stay in a hotel and invoice npower?

Very very poor customer relationship building. Two complaints about bills and the estimation system that they have put me in hundreds of pounds of 'debt' to Npower. After resolving the first complaint and Npower advising on the 'correct' monthly bills, I then received a further bill for another few hundred pounds because of incorrect estimation and the guy on the end of the phone even agreed that it was a 'service error' to which the standard reduction from this wrongly billed amount was ¬£25...shocking service...have now switched.

I wouldn't even give 1 star if there was an option!!!

We signed up with NPower after moving into a new flat last year. From the onset, the billing was very confusing. The website and the paper bills are packed with jargon and fine print and it's nearly impossible to make sure you are being billed correctly.

We finally decided to switch suppliers and that's where the real trouble began. We got a final bill for nearly ¬£300 when our monthly gas and electric all year had only been around ¬£50pm. When I called to question the issue, I was told that this was the correct amount. I spoke with 3 different agents and used the online chat 2 times as well and continued to get the same unhelpful response. Everyone I spoke to agreed that this number seemed extremely high compared to our normal usage, but insisted that this was, in fact, the correct amount and there was nothing else they could do for me.

Finally, on my 5th interaction, a customer service person suggested that perhaps our ending meter read was incorrect. When I investigated further, I found out that they had taken an ""Estimated End Read"" and that, indeed, it far exceeded the correct number. At this point, our new company needed to work with NPower in order to calculate a new estimated end read. We were told this could take a few weeks to sort out. I informed NPower of the issue and they assured me that they would put the account on hold while the issue was resolved so that my account wouldn't be passed onto collection agencies.

Unfortunately, this promise was not kept and a week later I started receiving texts, phone calls, and letters from collections agencies. I called NPower and they said that, unfortunately, the account had already been passed to the collection agencies and I would have to deal with them directly. They gave me a phone number to call and it was THE WRONG COLLECTION AGENCY?! So I had to find out myself which agency had our account and try to sort it out with them.

This went on for 2 MONTHS!!!! To make matters worse, NPower gave our electric bill to one collection agency and our gas bill to a different one!! So, for 2 months, I called the collection agencies, NPower, and my new supplier trying to stay updated on the progress of our account. Even though I reported the issue to all parties, I continued to get late payment notices and the collection agencies told me that NPower was adding additional administration fees to my debt as the bill was still not paid!!

Finally, the new estimate was agreed upon between NPower and my new company, but it still took NPower ages to send me a final bill! I even called them personally to give them the new estimate as I was told by an NPower customer service rep that this would help to speed up the process.

Every time I called NPower, they seemed to have NO RECORD of my previous phone calls and so each time I had to explain the entire predicament.

When I finally got a new bill it was still higher than our average bills had been, but at this point I just wanted to be done dealing with NPower. They sent me some weird card with crazy instructions on how to pay off my final bill. The final bill looked like a child's math homework with all these bizarre calculations on it. I'm still not confident that it was correct.

All in all, NPower were extremely unhelpful and unorganized. I have never had such a horrible experience. Someone actually tried to call me to ask if I was satisfied with my experience and if my issue had been resolved - but he also had no idea what my issue was and had no record of the proceedings!!

I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE!!! I am always polite, organized, and respectful of customer service representatives. I believe this company has a deep-rooted organizational problem and therefore customer service workers are left floundering - unsure how to properly resolve people's issues.

Be warned!!!

Days wasted waiting in for missed appointments, days wasted on the phone when I add up the hours calling / holding and talking to call centre staff who clearly don't  have a clue.

npower acted just like a theft! 
npower charged me more than ¬£300 for nothing I used. The corresponding statements were duplicates of others which I have been charged already. My account on their website is in an absolute mess - many statements and many cancellations - very, very difficult to work out what readings were used and from when to when.
Phoned them and spent more than 2 hours on phone, spoke to 3 persons. At first try to deceive me, then finally admitted there were mistakes but didn't know how it happened. Logged an complaint and waiting - Angry! If not for my patient and a big effort, I would be robbed for the money - very difficult to find out. Because I have been paying by direct debit, and all payments were taken off from the balance.

Any problem you have with them, take it to the ombudsman! The company has been fined millions for their bad practices already. Staff lack training. Kept giving the wrong values to me when I was asking how much I owe. I.T. issues are a definite reason behind this. Last but not least, they deliberately reduced my payments and presented me with bills that were showing how I was paying less and how I started owing them more. They had no excuses when I asked.

I renewed my account last year as they had the cheapest tariff. I had a shortfall at the time about ¬£45.00 I think and was assured that the new lower payment included this shortfall. When I read my new statement today I found that I had used 16% less electricity but still had a ¬£44.00 shortfall and So their figures dont add up. 

I went on to the chatline and after clearing security including my date of birth showing I was 62. I was asked if I wanted to give the name and telephone number of another contact  in case of an emergency and did I have someone else who could take the readings for me! Who the hell do N power think they are! The operative did not understand my reply that I was 62 could still read and did not need a carer, so repeated the offending questions!
I still didn't get a satisfactory answer about the shortfall and the reduction in usage. So after I refused to sign up for another 12 months He signed off.

Needless to say ill be looking for another Electricity supplier

HIGH COURT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST NPOWER LIMITED

NPower blocked my switch to OVO no less than 7 times even though the Energy Ombudsman upheld all of my complaints which included ""Not blocking my transfer to OVO Energy"" 

I then put Npower on legal notice of my intention to seek a High Court Injunction, needless to say Npower ignored the legal notice.

Having then filed an Application, Affidavit and Exhibits for an Interim Injunction at the Swindon High Court the the matter has now been set down for a hearing on the 26th September 2016 at Swindon Combined Courts, Npower has now been served with the above legal papers.

My advice is to keep well away from Npower as they are, for very obvious reasons bottom of all the ratings whilst OVO Energy is at the top!

Set up to transfer To NPower as a dual fuel supplier around the 10th of August but by the 31st August the account progress logo hadn't moved so I called their customer service. Spoke to a perfectly nice advisor who told me the account application had frozen (technical error at their end) and she would sort it within 24hrs and let me know what was happening. Not a total surprise but no call and the logo still showed no movement. A live chat log in on the 3rd and entered into a conversation only for the customer service person to disconnects the conversation. I then completed a complaint straight away (and received acknowledgement) but no update and no account movement. Just called again to cancel order. What a shower !!

They get 2 stars instead of 1 purely because the tariff is competitive and the lady I just spoke to with my complaint was polite.  But otherwise my experience with them has been very frustrating.  I called to change my tariff on 03/08.  When I checked my account today, 01/09, no changes had been actioned and my monthly direct debit has gone through today at the old higher amount.  I will now have to check my account again after 5 working days to ensure the changes have been made, and backdated, and that they have reimbursed the difference between what has been taken by DD and what should have been taken.  I will also have to check that no termination fee has been taken.  I was told on 04/08 that a termination fee would not be charged as I was not changing supplier, just the tariff.  Today I was told that the fee would apply, so I had to argue that one through.  It's a hassle I can do without.  And it's not the first time, this all happened the last time I switched tariffs with them as well.

After a year and a half of trying to resolve a bill discrepancy, I finally gave in to Npower and paid an incorrect bill. I asked for the situation to be escalated, which they never did - They took the wrong meter reading for a different house and tried to charge me for nearly three times the amount we eventually settled on! How do you make such a colossal mistake like that? After approximately 30 calls (which I had to make to them) and generic, threatening letters in the post, I finally had to give in due to their incompetence. They are the worst, most revolting company I have ever had the displeasure to be involved with.

Crap customer service from march to date (July). After recieving 16 wrong bills and making countless phone calls i decided to ring Paul Coffey CEO & was appointed a service manager who agreed the customer service was appalling and sorted the bill with the correct bill of ¬£29 not ¬£104. Some other customer service manager decided as a good will gesture to nil the bill and close the complaint. I dont think so!!! Rung and had complaint reopened and recieved 5 letters and another bill of ¬£29 despite this bill being nilled. Anyway they sent me a leaflet about there customer standard and from January 2016 they pay ¬£30 compo if they dont correct whats went wrong. I called 7 times before CEO office sorted it so thats 7 calls x¬£30 is ¬£210. So i called and explained this but my allocated complaints manager can only make this decision, so its another call to CEO office on Monday to get the ball rolling again....lol...Always fight for compo as they have agreed this with ofgem after being fined ¬£26m for crap customer service in Dec 2015...

Switched gas and elec to npower early Feb 2016. It's the end of May and only elec has gone across with an estimate of mid-July for gas. The switch for both should take 2-3 weeks - I'm looking at 5-6 months with no definite date for gas! 

They have also told me that as they only provide one fuel the dual fuel price offer/discount will not apply and I'll have to pay more!

I have chased this up with their customer services on 4 separate occasions, has complaints raised twice by them on my behalf with promised call backs and have received no call backs.

First the customer service is the worst (and that is some statement) I have had the misfortune to experience, from advisors lying to being rude then hanging up it's incredibly bad.

Worst of all the stealth charges they try to make you pay, people often talk about the third world is riddled with corruption, however it's this idealogy which allows scam artists like NPower to get away with it.

How much will I be owe by then! I am very careful about how much we use and nothing has changed in the household. How can I go from electric bills of 250 to 700 and counting? It has gone up over 60 pounds in just a week and a half since my last call - the woman never phoned me back so I had to call them yet again! I feel sick.

Never touch this company, don't know how to bill. Don't know how to talk to customers, rude, we move house in 2013 there moving team never shut our account down, we were paying for two properties, but never showed up on our bill, the monthly direct debit just kept going up for three years. When I did find out what was going on, there refunded quite a bit of money back. Then there decided there gave us too much and ask for it back. Now we owe then alot of money. Tuck them to the ombudsman, what a waste of time there are.

This company should not be allowed to continue trading. Abysmal. 

Three missed appointments to change meter from white meter to standard meter (pensioners on pension credit so we missed out on several months savings that we eventually achieved by changing to standard meter).  No calls to say they wouldn't be coming. 

Continually tried to increase our direct debit despite us using 30% less electricity than was estimated we'd use when monthly payment was set. 

Online bills charged a much higher kWh unit charge to what we had fixed for 12 months. Took months to rectify all the problems. Customer services non existent.

PLEASE, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SANITY, DO NOT TOUCH THIS COMPANY.

Shouldn't be allowed to trade. In August 2014 we were told that we had to have the gas meter changed, but when they put it in they've Came to change it they didn't record reading of the meter they took out or the one they put in. When we tried to get some money back as we had a lot of credit as we pay by did. We were told the meter readings were wrong and it was under investigation. We were made to feel like criminals. My husband passed away very suddenly in Jan 2015 and I then had to deal with their bereavement team. WHAT A  JOKE. I was made to change acct numbers as the acct was in my late husbands name. Eventually I had to get my MP involved. They soon sorted it out then and refunded 6 months gas.  Disgraceful. Now with OVO.

Would not ever recommend NPower to anyone! When I first set up the account it took 5 months for them to get the direct debit sorted. I kept getting a letter saying I owe them money but I had called to set up a direct debit over 5 times but for whatever reason they would say it was set up but then a month later no money was taken from my account. 

When I closed my account I was in credit of ¬£60.00. That was 4 months ago and I'm still waiting for this refund. I keep calling to chase, they tell me its sorted but then no money shows in my account! I will keep chasing my refund but I am so frustrated with them.

I wish I could give a minus figure. My daughters gas went off on Sunday, she couldn't get customer service, so had to wait until Monday. She has been told she doesn't have an account, they asked for her post code. When an engineer finally came he stated he couldn't do medium flow meters so left. My daughter has waited in everyday in a cold house either phoning or waiting for an engineer who will be coming in the next 4 hours. It is now Thursday and after yet another phone call they can't find a record of the job. Surely a woman who has a ten year old daughter, who has been without heating or hot water for 5 days in November, should be a priority. I was glad when I finally changed my supplier because npower couldn't generate my final gas/electric bill for 12 months.
Sadly they haven't improved. They should be ashamed of themselves for such a bad service for their customers

Worst company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. Appalling level of customer service. Wanted one online account & to pay by DD & they failed miserably. I had to refer the matter to the Ombudsman which needless to say I won. The last correspondence I received was a bullying court letter stating that despite attempts to contact me I had not got back to them. This despite the numerous calls & emails to them just shows the level of incompetence at which they operate. Even after receiving letters from them confirming my complaints were being dealt with and they could not tell me what they were charging me for. Staff are useless. The management worst.

Great at taking your money - really really bad at giving it back......

Firstly as many other customers have experienced they have increased my DD's which left me ¬£335 in credit at the time of my changing supplier.

When my final bill was generated they advised me that my bank had blocked them from crediting my bank account with the money owed to me. (my bank denied this would ever happen).  They then advised I would receive a cheque in  the post which never arrived.....now it's been passed to a 'specialist team' who are going to investigate why I haven't received my refund.   This is going to take 50 days this is after the 25 days it's taken them to tell me they haven't been able to refund me.

So basically they have ¬£355 of my money sitting in their account earning them interest as well as god know how many other customers accounts which are in credit and there's nothing I can do about it.

We kept telling them that our bill was wrong and after a year we were sick of the poor service so we changed supplier. On leaving them we asked for a final bill but kept getting estimated bills so we rang them again at the beginning of September but over a month later still no final bill. Today we find out they have gone into our bank account and just taken over ¬£800 without informing us. Straight away we phoned customer service and after constantly insisting that we talk to a manager one came on the phone, not that it did us any good a chocolate teapot is more use. After going round and round in circles and trying to explain that just going into someone bank account and taking money is theft we gave up and are going to speak to a solicitor and the ombudsman.

The worst of the worst Npower system to change the meters:

I ordered Npower to change the billing meter to top up meters for GAS and Electricity. First takes one and half month to book the engineer to come with 5 phone calls, first three customer service said they done the booking, but 3 weeks later, no engineer came out to the appointment, wasted me half of day. Then I call them back, Npower said the staff did not call the gas meter team to book an engineer. I was like what????? Then, Npower gave me a phone number and told me to book a meter engineer by myself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.!!!!!!! 
So the meter guy came, changed the meter, I thought this is done. Then, I still receiving the bill from the Npower for the top up meter!!!! Then I phoned them again, after 10 more calls and complaint, it was because the meter guy did not report back to Npower with all the information regarding the old and new meter numbers and readings, so, that why Npower charging me double!!!! First, I am not the one to install the meter, second, I was not informed that I need to report back with all the information, but end up, I need to look for all the information and report back to Npower by myself, this is total waste of time, and some of the Npower staff is just rough and impolite.  At the end Npower said they will update my top up meter within 90 days !!!!!!!!!!

NPower are the most incompetent company I have ever heard of, how they are still in business is beyond me. I rang up to give a final meter reading and get a settlement figure when I moved house in May only to be told that I was actually ¬£43 in credit. Imagine my surprise when a month later I was presented with a bill for ¬£248 and no explanation. They have made it as difficult as possible to get in touch with them to make a complaint and can't quite grasp the concept that they should not  harass people for payments (threatening bailiffs etc..) when they payment  figure is still in dispute. Take my advice, DO NOT go to NPower for any of  your energy needs. Avoid like the plague!!!

60% increase in direct debit, followed by excessive in credit balance, followed by APP advising no direct debit would be taken in September, followed by full direct debit being taken. Also advised APP not displaying info as it should.

Asked for response to FALSE information on direct debit on APP and APP failure. NO RESPONSE in the time frame they advised.

Tried contact through appropriate method in APP they advised I should contact via other method!

Asked for credit balance back as monthly D/D covered more than enough, NO RESPONSE.

Decided to switch user & advised credit balance would take 40-45 days to be repaid. The disrespect for the customer is appalling.

Abyssmal service.  When tenant left, it was found she had had a prepayment meter installed due to debt.  We were unable to get any energy at all without acquiring from Npower a Gas prepayment card, and resetting the Electric key which had been left behind.  Paid for every unit of energy used, and left meters in credit, giving meter readings when we took the property back and when it was sold.  We are being bombarded with demands for money which we quite clearly do not owe. NPower are stating our account nos which are incorrect, meter readings which are non-existent and not possible, due to meters having been changed to prepay in June 2014. One of their operatives came to check and read meters, by appointment, but still no joy.  What can we legally do to get these cowboys off our back?

I asked how this is possible as im in my house from 6pm until 7am and im only awake about 7 of those hours. I only have electricity as I live in a flat the heating is never used and I have a small 2 bed flat. I asked to have the meter checked to be told it will cost me 90 If they send someone  to check it and its all ok. im currently waiting on the phone to talk to them and have been waiting 58 mins. they want me to pay 130 per month for just electricity and another 50 on top to clear the debt I don't think I owe. so all in I have to pay 180 to my electricity company as a single mother of two working full time and paying to have both my children in childcare I cannot afford this extra bill. they said cut back on energy use. how when im not hardly home as it is.

We moved house back in October and signed up to Npower in November.  When we signed up the cost seemed a little low but hey who was to argue. How ever they had hooked me in. The next quarter the bill came in and bang a huge debit in the account and so the DD was increased from ¬£40 to ¬£98. Ok I could see that that original one was way off. 

Then we move on a few months to June. I get a call from some one at Npower dear Mr X we have a problem when you set up the account the DD for the gas was never set up! I was totalled unhappy. However before hey could look into it they wanted my current readings but I was at work so they said they would ring back later that night. He also offered to look at the tariff to see if they put me on the lowest one.  No call ever came in. 

A week later I get a call from someone who goes through the situation and says well you now need to pay ¬£178 per month plus extra to cover the deficit left so it is now ¬£230 per month so from ¬£40 to ¬£98 to ¬£230! Aft the end he said is there anything that he could I said well two things an apology would be nice, the reply was its no body's fault sir, and then I explained that the first person who rang offered to look at the tariff and after some arguing he looked and said oh you are on the lowest one good bye. 

When I get home I get an alert from equifax Dr Mr X your credit rating has dropped from excellent to poor as Npower have black marked you as none payment for 6 months. So obviously the person at Npower has taken upon himself to report me to Equifax when until a week earlier I had no idea and they had not said anything. 

So I complained to Npower and a week later they rang and corrected the Equifax scoring but only for three months so my score only rose to good. They only offered ¬£50 as compensation. This week my wife and I went for joint account guess what refused and what is worse they cancelled my contactless card and gave me a basic one due to the scoring. 

Finally after all this I went online to make sure the DD was set up and guess what there was a section saying our lowest tarriff could save you ¬£232 per year switch here. So there was a lower tariff after all!

So all in all a terrible experience after I had done nothing wrong. The person I spoke to had obviously taken upon himself to report me to equifax when I had technically not missed one payment. 

Never use Npower reel you in and then take you for a ride it will take months maybe years to get my credit rating back to where it was and I still owe them ¬£500 so are stuck with them until I can pay it off

I don't even buy energy from them, but they are billing me.

Spend hundred off hours in ""trying"" to talk to them, as I don't have an account with Npower they will not talk to me.

But it has not stopped them Serving Court papers on to me for money for current used energy of site, of which I pay at a different energy company.

Even UKnetworks say they have no rights of claim to my energy meter.

Even the energy company I pay, have written to Npower to tell them to stop billing me.

Npower's complaints procedure is not to reply to you, if you poke a worker to put an internal one for you, Npower will just sent out a dead lock letter with no explanation.

Zero stars, infact negative star review.

Do not get mixed up with Npower, they have not got a clue let alone energy.

We moved to a new tariff, 6 months later we were back on the old tariff! August, we sent final readings and left them, they acknowledged this. October they apologised that we were still on the wrong tariff! December after long phone call they said we were in credit ¬£122 but would close the account and refund us. A few days later they told us we owed them ¬£193. We had a 1 ¬Ω hour phone call in March said they would sort it. May they said they will close the account in 50 days!

You must be mad to use npower as your supplier. They over charged me for months resulting in a ¬£350 over payment when I asked for it back they said their using it to pay off future bills. When I got my bill (two weeks later) they said they made a mistake and underestimated my readings although I kept them up to date with regular readings.  They are blatantly trying to rip me off by changing their own readings. I am now switching my electric supplier and passing my case to the ombudsmen.

I moved into my new house 15 months ago and had a welcome letter in my name from n power shortly after saying I'd get my first bill in 3 months. . After no bill been sent out I rang them as I was worried about getting into debt ...They assured me the problem was sorted .. several months down the line and several more attempts contacting and seeking to customer services j was still getting bills in someone else's name that off course I could not open ...every n power letter that came I rang n power straight away to try and sort it but they were saying my name wasn't on the acount ...iv now been given 2 weeks to pay 1500 in my name ....so for the last 15 months iv contacted them more than 8 times and now they finally have mu details j have a huge bill ...to me this doesn't seem fair ...as a single mum who's tried my best to resolve this problem and hours on the phone should I be elegance for this bill????

Npower have tested my patience.... And I'm losing! No bill for months on end, incorrect and duplicated bills then received. Opened a complaint/disputed and although they acknowledged that they had messed up (repeatedly), they couldn't put the situation right and put a default on my credit report! The staff are useless and often slag npower off themselves. I've switched supplier (e-on, who are much better), but npower are still threatening legal action on an account that is closed and satisfied (which they acknowledge). They are incompetent ameatures-don't put yourself through the experience! Even hearing their bulls**t adverts on the radio and tv agitates me now!

After not billing us for 18+ months we got a huge bill mid-last year. We had an odd 2-meter setup and had one removed because we wanted to switch companies. 8 months on they still cannot update the meter record and so we cannot switch. We seem locked into nPower whatever we try and stuck on the standard tariff. And now they are not billing again so we expect another large bill in, I dunno, 2 years time maybe. We want to switch to dual fuel with another provider but no chance - tried uSwitch to SSE and got told that as we have a non-standard meter setup (because nPower cannot change the data!) we cannot switch. How difficult can it be! I wonder if this Omid Djalili guy knows exactly what he's put his face on...

I moved out of my house august 2014 and thought i had settled both electricity and gas in october when after hassling them they finally produced a bill. Thought it was all settled but it turns out they had not settled the gas. They omitted to mention that. Why on earth i would settle one and not the other is beyond me.
In January!! yes 6 months later,  i got a bill for ¬£40 (interestingly it was dated may 2011)  
 i was way working for the first three months so got back to messages from a debt collection agency which was the first i heard about it
Just spoke to npower who would only reduce it by ¬£25 instead of wiping as any normal company would have done after being 6 months late with a bill  - just paid it but will put this story on as many websites as possible so people understand how incompetent and inept this company is.

I wish we had NEVER gone with npower! We have a MASSIVE DEBT now because of them. When we moved house we called npower to pay our final bill which we had been waiting for, for about 8 months because they hadnt been able to bill due to a problem with their systems. We were unable to pay and called on numerous occassions however npower could still not provide us with a bill. 2 years on and we have received many bills all of which have been different to the next which we have disputed, we have had bills for periods we were not living in the property, bills with different account numbers and the wrong address. It has been to the complaints department 3 times and all 3 times the complaint has been closed without my knowledge. So I took it to the energy ombudsman who to be honest werent really much help as we were hoping for the bill to be written off as n power have never been able to produce a correct bill in the last 2 years so we are not at all confident that the final bill they 'say' is now the correct one is right. The ombusdman suggested to npower a small amount of compensation, an extended re payment period to suit our needs (which actually isnt any different to their standard repayment period) and now we have another bill, to pay each month of ¬£50 which we would never have had, had n power taken payment from us when we tried on the numerous occassions to pay and then they had the cheek to turn around and say ""well you should have kept the money back"" .... in two years alot can happen and circumstances change, we had the money then and THEY wouldnt take it, 2 years on we dont have that sort of money now and we cant afford an extra bill of ¬£50 a month either. We are still not confident the bill is right and demanded our account to be reviewed through the back billing code of practice which n power did not seem to want to do atall and took my partner alot of arguing with them to say they would do it, this is our current situation at the moment and we hoping something comes from this otherwise I have no idea where we go with this ... I am so angry at n power that we are in the position we are in at the moment and all because of them, their fault not ours. I would NEVER use n power again and i certainly will not be recommending them to anyone in the future.

moved into a new house in June 2014, up until today I still haven't received a bill. it has been problem after problem, firstly the opening reads given to them by British Gas, they couldnt get right and apply to the account correctly, took them 6 months to get the account correct and the serial numbers for the meters confirmed with thier ""bak office team""!!
I was expecting a bill in december in line with their direct debit 6 month billing cycle, but could see online, bill wasn't going to be generated until April 7th 2015, rang to be told that there was a problem with the account and there was nothing they could do!?

Bearing in mind, this account was a brand new account, with a new house, with opening reads given to them, bi-weekly meter readings sent to them by myself, and yet they still couldnt generate a bill.

7th April came, SMS received to say there was a problem with the account (surprise surprise) and they would fix asap. log in to online account to see next bill is due 1st July!?!?!?!?!

Rang to find out why this was, billing department rang their complaints department who fixed something on the account which was apparently minor. Cue the complaints department swapping the elec and gas readings round, screwing my bill and the past 10/11 months of meter reads gone! Only found they had made the mistake of swapping the reads round when I asked why I owed them ¬£225, after working out I owed approx ¬£600, account in credit by ¬£850!!

Rang back after getting cut off, to be told by billing that it would be 10 days to investigate (their) mistake on the account, after speaking to the web team and speaking to a very helpful Simone, readings have been rectified today and bill should be generated 3-5 days.

After all this, this is no way to, A) run a business and more importantly, B) treat your customers.

There's no excuse for the ineptness on N-Power's behalf and all the apologies in the world cannot make up for being left in the dark, not knowing whether you've over/underpaid your bill. bearing in mind these show up on your credit scoring, its extremely important they don't mess anything up.

The ¬£50 exit fee per fuel is looking extremely attractive as I'm not sure I can hack another 2 years with N-Power.

Avoid like the plague!!!

Took 20 months of constant requests to get a bill and then it was clearly wrong. Gave us 3 different account numbers during this process and a starting balance of -¬£800 that never existed - we were new customers with a ¬£0 balance ?

Regular 30-40 mins plus on hold while trying to get through and talk to someone, countless promises made to resolve our complaints then open complaints closed down with no warning. They lost our meter readings and couldn't even tell us which tariff we were on !

After 26 months we have still got nowhere, our case now referred to the ombudsman.

Don't go near them.  I complained about not getting a bill for about 18 months.  All my telephone complaints got lost so I started to send them by email.  My first two email complaints (according to Npower) didn't count as they didn't give me a complaints number although I got a email reply headed 'Complaint' from them.
Then I got a number and was told my bill would take 28 days to generate but my complaint would expire after 10 days.  No bill arrived so I started again, and again and again.  After five complaints and still not a correct bill I wrote to the Chief Executive.
Even then no one read my complaint - still they ignored all my concerns, I even when gave them the readings I had taken regularly over the period (now two years). The executive complaints team re-did the calculation again still using the wrong dates and the wrong meter readings and concluded I didn't have a complaint.
For information I did discover that the not charging for electricity if they haven't billed you for over a year only works if you pay when your bill arrives.  If you pay by direct debit then they still keep the amount you have paid on account they just don't charge if it would have cost more.  Hence my neighbour got ¬£450 knocked off his bill and I got ¬£13.
I have given up trying to get Npower to understand the simplest of complaints and I have moved to another supplier, no they weren't much cheaper but at least when I ring them then something happens.

Given them one star as you can't give less. Currently in dispute with them as I brought to their attention that I hadn't had a bill for over 18 months and was over ¬£1700.00 in credit. They cannot bill u for energy used over 12 months old so in theory, only need to Bill me for the last 12 months. They are now trying to tell me I have used nearly ¬£3000.00 in energy in the last year and that I am in debit to them for ¬£700. Have started the switch today to go elsewhere. This is meant to be going through ombudsman who quite honestly, are nearly as bad! Don't go to npower!

I was with npower for just over a year. During this time I was paying ¬£68 a month for a 2 bed flat where I lived alone. A few months in, I was sent a bill saying that my direct debit was going to be increased to ¬£200 a month!! I contested this and it was put down to a computer default. And returned to my normal rate. Towards the end of my tenancy I was sent a bill to say that I was ¬£700 in credit. I called to collect this money, but was told that it would be refunded to me on the closure of my account or if I continued with them as a provider, my payments would be reduced next year to included this money. On closing the account I was sent a final bill for ¬£770.06! For a years worth of electricity and with paying direct debits. I contested this, but was told it was correct.  I went to the financial ombudsman who investigated and told me the calculations were correct but a goodwill gesture would be taken off, if I was to accept that the bill was correct.  Today, 13 months after leaving the property I have been sent a bill from npower for ¬£4.62! After all this time they have readjusted my bill and actually looked at my usage over the year instead of trying to grab my money. I have paid his amount and will never again use npower as a fuel provider. If I were you, I would stay away. Nothing but stress and worry about the extra money...which I do not have!! I should sue for this stress and worry!!!!

Not to worry they said you are top of queue now(Nov 2014) it will be sorted and we will compensate you plus back billing will come into it!  Its now February 2015 and still no bill have been in touch with Ombudsman - total waste of time as they cant do anything as they are aware of issue with Npower so I don't know who to turn too!  Even if I leave Npower been told it wont generate a bill so what do I do - hang on and wait and get compo but possibly lose out on cheaper competition or say enough is enough, leave and keep waiting for bill to eventually arrive?

Even though im in so much credit they seem to change my dd payments higher after sorting that i requsted some refund not the whole amount. And since november still no refund. After ringing again today 20/01/15 they have no answer why i havent got it wouldnt lodge a complaint.. i mean why cant they just do as they say... instead every phone call i am back to square one and now i have to start a process again get new reading and call back... i know its not a big thing but when you are diasbled and use aids its not easy reaching the meter to read it.. and having to wait till someone can come and do it for me.. and ill most likely have to wait again to get told it will be another month before i get this refund... ive never come across a service so slack and unfair and upsetting... apaulling customer service and i have  decided to report and find another provider.. im 67 and never had a problem with other providers and now im in the worst days with health i have issues again and again with npower.. i would not reccommend to anyone and cannot wait to move

Am with Npower for both my gas and electric and up till February 2014 paid by direct debit for both, but after numerous phone calls did not receive a bill for either for almost 2 years. Then got back dated bills in January 2014 showing I was in credit by over ¬£900 for gas however got another bill in February 2014 stating I owe them over ¬£1200 for gas. I rang was told I hadn't received bill for 2 years and was told they had problems with their system which isn't my problem. Was told that they would send my account to the back office to investigate and someone will be in touch once resolved (28 days max) Since have made numerous calls and keep being told the same thing. No one can explain how I was in credit and then in less than 4 weeks owe them over ¬£1200 for gas all I keep being told is there is something not right with your account (tell me something I don't know) stopped my direct debits in February 2014 as they were going to take out over ¬£300 a month. Still waiting for a reply have also sent emails but no reply. Keep being told my account is on hold till this is investigated but then I get letters threatening to cut me of and have to ring up again just seem to be going in circles. Not the first time this has happened but have had enough switching to British gas. Keep away from this company is all I can say.

Billed ¬£90 per month for energy (after they said they could save us money if we changed from British Gas). Did not inform us of any debt on the account, but we ended up running up a debt of ¬£800 in a matter of 2 - 3 months! They insist that we pay it all upfront, ""no room for negotiations"" from the customer service team. Other issues include wait times on hold for 1-2 hours at a time, they never call back when they say they will, and they have no concept of what they are doing to people! We have passed everything over to the Ombudsman and they are still seeking to get an attachment of earnings to pay off the debt that we do not owe! When we asked for all of our paper work to be sent through they charged us ¬£10, and also sent us random private and confidential information belonging to other customers!

Then you hear the excuse again that they are super busy (what a surprise people want to get in touch if your product is abysmal..., also, I am tired of this excuse now). Then the line cuts off after 10 minutes. You are supposed to whatsapp them. But they only reply a day later if you are lucky. You then get to engage with a customer adviser who behaves like a robot, barely motivated, has no clue and is not in the slighted interested in helping you. Replies can also take a day, if they come at all. So basically useless. I had to really fight to get to speak with someone over the phone, who was friendly but by that point I had already wasted so much time it didnt matter anymore. Also, even though I was in debit they reduced my DD payments to ¬£8/month for electricity, which is absolutey ridiculous. I only noticed months later because they only send out bills once every 6 months! Why??? That doesn't make any sense. Also their bills are so confusing not even my friend who is a CFO quite understood them. Shambles! Worst energy company I ever dealt with in my 17 years in the UK. I switched to Octopus energy where the system is so much easier and customer service is much better from what I hear and read.

Trying to get a correct bill for over 10 weeks. EDF insists on using a fictitious opening read to extort more money. Sent a photo of gas meter on 5/9/23 showing opening read, another two weeks later and then weekly but they just ignore it and use their own which is overcharging me by ¬£400. Have spoken to chat bots, call centres all over the world, energy agents, have made dozens of phone calls, emails to people all promising to put it right but to date still no action and demanding over payment, dishonest company. This has to be put right at some point and who will compensate me for the stress I have suffered and my valuable time.

The world's worst billing system. Hugely overly complicated bills that make no sense and are just muddled with estimates and actuals. One bill said an engineer took the reading one month which isn't true as I never let an engineer in to take the readings. EDF continue to confuse my monthly actuals with estimates and over charging me. So many wasted paper bills with contradicting billing information from one month to the next. Trying the get me to switch to a smart meter. Why can't they just accept my monthly actuals and stop with the meaningless, unhelpful estimates. I have taken this to the ombudsman but very early stages. Avoid EDF if you can as their billing system is beyond useless and stressful.

Shocking service 9 months of trying to get working smart meters and hours of complaining. Engineers that did not show when appointments were booked. We complained to the Ombudsman and EDF lied to the Ombudsman saying no call took place booking an appointment to try an wriggle out of paying redress that the Ombudsman stated ¬£60 and a gesture of Goodwill of ¬£200.  All this to say ¬£60 we asked for all our calls under a Data Subject Answer Request and got a recording of that call and sent it to the Ombudsman.. EDF still try to say it never took place as the complaints team could not be bothered listening to the calls.  The Ombudsman found in our favour. EDF will lie, you email the CEO he wont answer, Got to Octopus Energy at least they are honest and the same price, EDF are so bad I would give no stars if O could.  If you get nowhere with EDF go to Ombudsman they are really helpful.

I would love to be able to give this lot zero stars.
It seems to me that EDF could not organise a p** up in a brewery.
They must be one of the most incompetent companies I have had to deal with in my 46 years of farming.
We have two electric meters associated with the same property, one is a normal meter that supplies  the house and the other WAS an ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô meter. The tariff is from before the energy companies were privatised in 1990.
The ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô tariff is timed such that it is switched on 24/7 when the clocks are on British Summer Time but when on Greenwich Mean Time it is on all weekend and from 7pm to 7am from Monday to Friday. Due to changes we have made it now supplies the farmyard and we need power all the time. The timers are built into the meter.
I started the process of getting the meters swapped out for smart meters at the end July/beginning of August. The normal meter has been done, but up until now the ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô meter is still in place. The ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô tariff no longer exists as I had it changed to the same as the other normal meter, so it is now on a ‚Äò‚Äôday‚Äô‚Äô tariff and NOT ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô. 
Their complaints resolution guys I have been communicating with agree with me that the meter should be replaced. But for some reason, and they will not tell my why, both their customer services and smart exchange departments think the ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô meter is not eligible for replacement. It seems to me that some departments act on old data/emails and do not keep up to date. There is a great lack of joined up thinking and action and a definite lack of communication.
My problem is that I need power in the farm yard when the clocks change to Greenwich Mean Time to power a water pump, amongst other things,  to provide water to livestock on the farm. They need water 24/7. EDF have been told that on several occasions. 
I have now been told, and I quote ‚Äò‚ÄôWe are currently waiting on approval to get a legacy standard credit meter installed to ensure you do not go off supply‚Äô‚Äô. I assume they will swap out the ‚Äò‚Äôoff peak‚Äô‚Äô meter for this other one and then swap that for a smart meter at a later date. To my way of thinking it would make more sense & be cheaper to go straight to a smart meter, but up to them. Due to the problems I have had up to now I am not holding my breath.
If nothing is done by the time the clocks change to GMT I will be taking this further. This has been going on for far too long & should have been sorted out a long time ago.
It has and still is causing me a lot of frustration.

EDF fitted two smart meters in my property in February but couldn't commission one of them on the day as their system was down. I was supposed to be contacted by EDF to arrange a follow up appointment which never materialised. After requesting a call back on live chat (as it is impossible to get hold of anyone on the phone) someone finally phoned me back to arrange a follow up appointment. I have had 4 engineer visits subsequently over a 7-month period which have each involved taking time off work and the problem is yet to be resolved. I raised a complaint with EDF back in August and have received a weekly call from a call centre ever since trying to persuade me to close my complaint despite it not being resolved which I find bizarre. The issue is still not resolved, and I have just received a letter from EDF to say we 'have reached a point of deadlock'. My advice to anyone would be avoid EDF at all costs. Their customer service is dreadful and are unable or unwilling to rectify simple problems. I am now having to take the issue up with the energy ombudsman which I could really do without.

They ask you to show kindness and respect when talking to customer services. I don‚Äôt think asking me to hold and leaving me on hold for 45 minutes is showing me kindness and respect!!! I ended up having to end the call because I had to go and pick the kids up from school. I have been phoning them every week asking, which has now turned into BEGGING them for an up-to-date gas bill. I have phoned and given gas and electricity readings to a human being in customer services for 2 months and still NO BILL and electric only up to 8 Sep 2023! And to top it off every bill since 27 Aug 2023 shows YOU PAID US ¬£0.00 !!! Where in the world has EDF got their customer services based because they are absolutely incompetent!

After visit of electric engineer, my income display not responding. Engineer told that they exchanged the electric meter for new and in couple days they will connect it remotely on other end to the system. After months and moths of back and fourth it's still not sorted. They telling that it's not possible to register new meter to my account. They send me 50¬£ as good will and want me to accept as it is. But unfortunately I'm unable to accept this as cannot read meter and put reading to them as most of the time away and nearly got missed last time and need to book fly in emergency to read meter readings.
It's they Engineer took of the meter wich was working with the system. Its them now reject to assist. Its them reject to register my meter to system. Customer services rude and just sending my around by circle and then promising to sort ti's in couple days and then ignoring my issue. And then again all repeat and going by circle again and again. Looking now to take legal action against EDF as they broke my setup and don't want to repair.

The billing system they use to to raise a finger in the air and guess how much energy you use then add on another ¬£200 on top of it!
Get a smart meter they said we can then charge you for you use!! oh no you then get 2 bills a month which are completly different! you pay one and then get a letter saying you are in debt and they dont want to send pepole round but may have to.

It has been seven months now and I am still being harassed by EDF and their debt chasing agencies to pay an estimated bill for an unoccupied property of c¬£1200. Having supplied EDF with actual readings along with photographic evidence of their veracity, this company still refuses to provide me with an invoice for actual energy use plus standing charges for the period when no-one was living in the house. I calculated the debt myself to be c¬£132, which I have already paid, but this action has only caused EDF to double down and harass me further by proliferating demands from their so-called 'complaints' department - none of which makes sense, and all of which are for different amounts - demanding that I reply within 24 hours. This is just bullying. I have a brain damaged partner and stepchildren to look after, I can only work part-time on a per hour wage from home as a result, and I do not need this stress. Is there anyone else out there being bullied wit fraudulent demands for non-existent energy use? EDF are 64 billion euros in debt according to the Guardian (Feb 2023) - this is no way to recoup that loss.

After my sister died last year in London, I had to travel to London to sort out her affairs. This involved closing all utilities. Four of these had credits to be paid. Three companies processed these reasonably easily by doing a direct credit into a UK account   
EDF however have been obstinate and maintains they can only issue a cheque.  (a policy not a physical restraint)  They have issued this cheque twice now and each time somewhere in the chain the cheque has got lost in the mail. between the UK and NZ and but to a UK Bank to be banked.
Even after lodging a complaint, they are saying they can't help just do a direct credit .....and we are only talking about 100 pounds. 
As a company, they have been difficult to deal with from the very beginning.

We have signed up for DD for all our supplies, but EDF did NOT activate the instructions for all our supplies, they missed some out. Because EDF has not activated the DD instructions, they charge each time 2 % extra for wrong payment method despite it was their own mistake! Although they were asked several times, for one of the supplies, the DD is still not activated after over 10 months! They promised last time back in May to get it sorted, but were unable to do so in further 3 months.
EDF also usually ignores any submitted meter readings even the start meter reads of new contracts!
For another supply EDF charged us Late Payment Interest for the days between payments for the invoices based on estimated and actual readings, although we were credit!

Having refused a smart meter in the past I decided to accept one as meter readings are monthly now and my meters are awkward to reach under the stairs. The meter was fitted 07.08.2023 but I was told it needed work from EDF before it was able to provide readings. 
I was contacted by text after calling EDF on more than one occasion and was offered an appointment for someone to fix this issue on either 29th or 31st August. I confirmed date and time for 29th only to be advised by text that this date is not available and they would come on 22nd. I accepted this appointment only to receive an email confirming they would attend on 18th August. 
On contacting EDF to ascertain which was the correct appointment I was told that the 18th had already been cancelled and they would be in touch. 
I rang this morning only to be told that there has been a mix up and no one has booked me an appointment but they can keep me informed of the situation on a weekly basis. 
I have never experienced such shoddy customer service ever.

I have been with EDF for just over 18 months and up to just recently, apart from their totally confusing accounting system, I have had a reasonable experience.

We pay by DD and had built up a healthy credit balance before my last six monthly bill just dropped. The bill was for less than half of my balance so happy days. Use the app to check the bill and my account is now showing zero balance? Confused, I was. 

Tried contacting EDF via the ridiculous app based AI bot and got nowhere so escalated it to speak to a human. Two days later I get a call from somewhere in the world from a woman who  I could not understand because of her accent and the background noise and got nowhere. Then a second call minutes later from another person, same deal, but she did speak slightly better English. So I asked why EDF had emptied my balance and it was rather like talking to a politician, I could not get a straight answer. She could not say why only that I would be credited back X amount in the next few days.  I told her this was the wrong amount, your bill says one thing and you are charging me another? Again no direct answer just kept saying that it was right when it clearly was not.

Six days later my balance is still zero and I suppose my only option now is to write a letter and change to another supplier, but judging by some of the other posts on here I‚Äôm not hopeful I will ever get this resolved.

Absolutely appalling customer service. After being bombarded with messages from EDF to have smart meters I finally agreed and smart meters were fitted Jul 2023. The display unit is not compatible with the meters and does not work. After numerous calls to totally incompetent EDF so called customer advisers I have been informed that the smart meters are not smart. They are working in legacy mode and will not submit readings. I will have to submit readings and I won't be able to check my energy usage. There nothing EDF can do about it. Disgusting response.
 I have a team of useless emails from incompetent advisers who do not have an clue how to handle customer complaints and just pass the buck. I have now had enough and am  contacting both my MP and the Energy Ombudsman. EDF are NOT FIT for purpose

Computer says ""NO""!! My flat was empty for 6 months before being sold, but EDF Energy would not accept meter reading that did not increase every month. I have wasted hours and hours and hours on the WhatsApp / Text / Phone to them trying to get it sorted. Even the customer service agents are not able to log a meter reading that has not increased. 2 months after the sale, and 4 official complaints later, and it is still not resolved!!

I gave them my move out date and 3 months later they are still direct debiting me.

Energy prices have gone through the roof and now thanks to edf I'm paying for 2 houses worth of energy. So I call them they apologise and tell me it will be taken care of

9 months later I notice I never got a refund and instead they just continued to charge me again. At this point I'm owed over 500 pounds.

Avoid avoid avoid this disgusting company.

The EDF bosses must love reading all these terrible reviews just laughing it up.

Horrible company with the most ridiculous billing systems. I have suffered massively where EDF has consistently, year after year billed me incorrect bills to the tune of ~ ¬£4k pounds. Multiple calls with their agents, escalation to their CEO, a lot of stress dealing with these issues . Super disappointing experience and a frustrated consumer after a series of interactions - has led me to provide a heavily negative review. I would never recommend them to any consumer.

Hopeless. Just hopeless. Currently ¬£2010 in credit due to the outrageously high DD I was ‚Äògiven‚Äô. Trying to get the money back is nearly impossible. Waited the 5 days quoted by customer service - no money back. Phoned again - cannot have it as the bill is outdated - 26/7 - it could have been done when I phoned on receipt of the bill. I had phoned on receipt of the bill - but because the member of staff did it all wrong I will need a new bill. So will be waiting up to 10 days for this to be generated. Complained, asked to speak to a manager. It seems you cannot do this. But my complaint was escalated and I would receive a call from them by the end of the working day. 2 days later, no call. This company is hopeless. Customer service is appalling and they take no responsibility for their shoddy service instead hiding behind their ‚Äòthat is our policy and operational procedure‚Äô mantra. Not sure why they should be able to sit on so much or my money, or why they refuse to reduce my direct debit. Not sure why I bothered with a smart meter either as they clearly do not take actual energy consumption into account preferring to take as much money as possible and then refuse to return it. I shall be changing suppliers as I have no words left to share with EDF.

Utter rubbish company , they will mother you to have a smart meter installed yet will not use this data for usage when billing.
They will set a monthly amount that hugely benefits them with extortionate credit building to their benefit.
This is a company that doesn‚Äôt invest in their billing systems and will overcharge so they build up a huge warchest, I know the competition is grim but avoid this one

I have been using EDF for a while and never had any problems. We have moved out of the property on the 28th of April and have submitted the meter readings accordingly, got my final bill of ¬£248, paid it all off in June as stated and just this morning I am receiving an email saying I owe them another ¬£107 for the same billing period as my final bill. So I have two final bills for the same period, 17th of March to 2nd of May. I have paid my final bill in June and now I wake up with another final bill. Just ridiculous‚Ä¶

If you value your mental health and your time, then EDF COMPANY is not for you. 

Your letters and arguments are ignored, it is difficult to get through on the phone and often the connection is cut off, the complete confusion you are led in a closed circle over and over again is only an imitation of helping customers.


I have been a customer of the EDF company for many years, and always pay all bills on time.

In September 2022 I paid a bill of ¬£261.61. 

But in October 2022 I received a huge bill for electricity for ¬£3,486,62

I have repeatedly asked EDF to send an engineer to inspect my meter for malfunctioning,  After a long negotiation EDF set me an appointment for 18 January 2023

When the electrician arrived, he informed me that he had arrived to install the smart meter. Although I have always told EDF that I will not change or install anything until we have checked whether my meter works properly or not.

I  explained the problem to the electrician. He inspected the meter, and noted that my meter is spinning very quickly, although at that time the heating and other electrical appliances did not work. He also said he understood the problem and that he would report it all, but to close the issue. Another appointment needs to be made and another duplicate meter installed to make sure the old one is correct. I was very pleased, hoping that this would now be resolved more quickly.

On 17th July 2023 EDF responded that they would not be able to send an engineer until the debt was settled. 

Whats going on?

I live in one bedroom flat, according to the readings of my electric meter over the past two months, my consumption has increased by more than three times. while I do not use heating, and try to be very economical

EDF has been refusing to send an engineer to check the servesability of its equipment for more than six months.And at the same time, through letters and calls, EDF are stubbornly trying to send me an engineer to install a smart meter, like its a panacea for all the problems, although we can observe that 
with smart meter, consumers also have a lot of problems. 

EDF Its like a one-way road, no dialogue, just EDF interest,throughout the months of letters and conversations, nothing has changed EDF is a large company with huge trained staff sharpened only for profit, and lonely consumers simply lack the strength and resources to defend their rights, and in the end, a lot of people do not want to be in this stress simply give up, and EDF becomes enriched.

This really started before EDF. to be fair my problems started before I was an EDF customer. I had a smart meter fitted December 2017 by ToTo energy I started to complain as soon as I realised that my gas bills were over double!! I also realised that my Smart Gas meter did not give a reading to the company. I could not get any support from any one. At the time I was in the awful situation of having both Daughter age 43, and my Husband dying of Cancer!! they died within 2 week's of one another in October 2018 as you can imagine fighting an energy company was not a priority.  I was then in shock for a long time, Then Covid arrived and once again I just paid my bills. We went through  several suppliers  including Bulb and Green energy, (due to firms going bust) before being put with EDF!  This was in May 2121 Green Energy did not even have the right meter number. I did complain to green energy about the cost of the gas and they reduced my bill to ¬£63 per month. When I moved to EDF I gave them my readings but they would not accept my gas reading!! I was in contact with them at least a couple of times a week. I explained that the Gas was to high and that I was sure that the meter was faulty. I asked them to INCREASE my DD because I was worried about being in debt. A manager phoned me and gave me a large credit and cancelled all previous bills and told me that when my credit was used up that I would be put on to a sensible DD. This was Nov 2021.  In the February 2022 I received  a bill for over ¬£1000 and wanting to put my DD up to ¬£901 per month!! I complained and they reduced it to ¬£640 per month I paid one month but as I am a single state pensioner, this was over ¬£200 more than my pension. On my bill it was saying that I use over 69000kw per year gas. The average for a 3 bed  detached house with 2 to 3 occupants is 12000kw per year!! I am on my own and hardly use the gas for heating because I use a wood burner that heats the whole house. Oct 22 I managed to get them to change the meters. Neither  meter connects to edf, and so they are still sending estimated bills The new gas meter proves that I use about 10000kw per year,but EDF won't accept it. what do I do.

After a year of numerous calls to sort out a smart meter to be told we have no signal then sending monthly manual readings, subsequent confusing bills, calls being cut off, contradictory information being told different information from customer services each time. The stress caused by EDF led us to leave to Octopus a joy in comparison. Despite numerous complaints not followed up or filed we will be taking this further via the ombudsman but I doubt they can even give a final resolution to out numerous complaints.

Almost feels like a scam this company.

Paid my bill (to begin with overcharged by ¬£130!). Kept getting emails telling me I hadn't paid the bill. When I called to query this and mentioned being overcharged in the first place I was more or less told that was my fault for not supplying the reading(I have a smart meter, isn't that the point of having one of those?) and that I needed to supply a bank statement as 'I might not be telling the truth'. Had to travel an hour there and back to the bank to get a statement to show them the amount that had been taken out on the 31st May.
It's surreal. They operate on sheer greed bordering on aggression if you're payment is a day or two late , with threats of further action. Just nasty, soulless, heartless, really need some kind of regulation to stop them behaving like some kind of mafia.

I am not impressed with EDF. We lived in a one bed flat and the heating was only on a few hours a day. They wanted on average ¬£300 a month for the bills. I moved out of the property but they are still harrassing me with a final bill of over ¬£650. I called to arrange paying in installments which was agreed but I get threatening letters every month from EDF about taking me to court even though I make the payments. I have called many times to complain about these letters and yet it continues. Today I was on the phone to them and the staff member was so rude I thought maybe it was a scammer. She said the payment installment was cancelled. I told her i did not want it cancelled. She was very aggressive and confrontational on the phone. I have never experienced such nastiness from any organisation before. This company is greedy and corrupt. Avoid using them. The customer service is ridiculous and the prices outrageous.

Avoid like the plague. Moved into a property supplied by EDF in Dec 2022 and thought that with current energy situation it made sense to stick with the existing supplier. Initially I tried to set up an account online but kept getting an error message so resorted to phoning and the resultant hour on hold. Finally got through to someone who claimed they had set me up an account and direct debit and that I would receive my account number by email.
A day goes by and no email with account number arrives. I phone again but stuck in Orwellian loop of being told that without my account number they cannot find my details and request that an account number be sent!

Eventually I resort to the dreaded chatbot and again request my account number. Chatbot replies after 3 days with a stock response that the conversation is closed due to 3 days elapsing!! Attempt chatbot again, this time after 2 days I receive a response with the golden ticket of the account number. 

So it has taken 5 days, 2 chatbot conversations, 2 phone calls and one online form just to get an account number. With my shiny new account number, I am able to download the app and manage my account online. I enter meter readings. 5 days later I get a text saying my meter readings have been accepted, however I look on my online account and they are nowhere to be seen.

There is no direct debit set up despite my request for one. I don't receive a bill for 2 months. When I finally do receive a bill, it is charging me a 'deemed' fee based on the price cap with no acknowledgement of any of my meter readings that have been submitted diligently within the timelines EDF request. I don't receive my next bill for another 2 and a half months later; it has now become clear that EDF like to keep an air of mystery around quite when they will charge you and how extortionate it will be.

EDF customer service are impossible to get hold of and I have little appetite to face the 3 day silent treatment from the chatbot again. EDF do however phone me up incessantly and persistently trying to enforce a smart meter on me (using misleading language about it being a government requirement). I have declined a smart meter multiple times. 

After 5 months of overinflated bills, ignored meter readings, a lack of access to customer service, inability for EDF to set up a simple direct debit, repeated harrassment over smart meters I leave EDF for Octopus. I am able to set up my account online, create a direct debit (with a quote of ¬£60 less a month than I was paying with EDF due to them acknowleding my usage) and submit meter readings in the space of 10 minutes - which is more than I was able to achieve with 5 months with EDF!

And, even after leaving EDF I get an out of hours phone call from the smart meter team yet again informing me that I 'must' have one fitted, despite no longer even being an EDF customer. It should hardly surprise me that EDF don't even know who is on their customer base as they barely acknowledged my existence even when I was there other than to try and flog me a smart meter.

To summarise: sign up for EDF today if you want to be ignored by customer service, enjoy interactions with the world's slowest chatbot, receive aggressive smart meter sales calls at all hours of the day, live in the exciting suspense of not knowing when a bill will come and how much it will be for, and pay bills far higher than your actual usage.

EDF are Crooks 

I have been with EDF for several years, in that time all that happened was my energy bill for gas and electricity went through the roof at ¬£244/month.

As I live by myself and am a low energy user this was intolerable so I looked around and saw Octopus was much cheaper at ¬£142/month.

These big energy companies such as EDF are Scum only interested in ripping their customers off. Their website is very confusing and offers little in the way of any real help, lower tariffs for instance.

Avoid these people at all costs

Avoid these people at all costs, they have been sending me bills randomly and I have always paid what they have asked. Last bill was for ¬£83, I read the meters , called them, and it was amended to ¬£97 which I paid for via phone.

Two days later I receive a bill for ¬£900+ telling me to ignore all other bills. The bill is for 5 months in a 1 bed flat with the Government ¬£66 payments already calculated, and me paying whenever a bill was sent. I apparently used over ¬£600 in gas alone in 3 months. 3 radiators hardly on and electric cooker.

I suspect they were not sending me the right bills as they wanted me to have a huge debt and force a smart meter to fitted, which they have been harassing me about for month. How could they have underestimated by so much?

I have never had such an issue with a supplier for over 40 years, EDF have only been my supplier for 15 months and have already put me into debt for nearly 1k.

We had 2 new meters fitted in early March of this year. Whilst the engineer was fitting them, he was on the phone to his colleague - and appeared to be having a lot of problems. He explained after fitting them, that I would have to contact EDF  within a week to arrange another engineers visit, because the meters were not connecting to EDF .He did not want to leave a display unit but I insisted that he did as it would still connect to the meter and show me what was being used.

I then rang EDF a few days later to explain that the meters were not connected and to arrange another visit as instructed by the engineer. The lady on the phone did not take on board what I was saying and advised that the meters would automatically connect within 2 weeks. After waiting around 3 weeks I rang up again and was told that the meters would connect automatically, but it would be a week or two.  2 months after the meters were installed I have now today rang  a third time. 

I waited quite a long 
Time in the telephone queue which appeared to start again
 I eventually got through  and spoke to a man. I explained to him that the meters were still not connected and that I would like to make a complaint.  The man advised me that he needed to go and get more details and asked if I could hold - which I did. 5 minutes later I heard an automatic response asking me - how would I rate my customer experience etc. The line then went dead.

I rang up again - waiting yet another 10 minutes, following all the correct prompts. After about 10 minutes the music stopped and then I was asked all of the same questions that were asked of me in the first phone call. Effectively kicking me out of the queue and starting again. This happened on the first call but I then realised the pattern. I believe now this is a way of reducing the waiting times and that the wait times do not go over their targets. I eventually got through to a young lady and explained that I would like to be out through to a supervisor and make a complaint. She went away and came back to advise me that the supervisor was on their break. 

I explained that there must be more than one supervisor and requested that she put me through to someone else. She said she would raise the complaint whilst waiting for the supervisor to become available. She did this and then said that she would pass me on to a supervisor. A woman came on to the phone and was immediately abrupt. I asked her how long they had to deal with a complaint before I could escalate to it the ombudsman. She stated 6 weeks - again very abruptly and said that I needed to send them a photograph of the meters. 

I said that was irrelevant and tried to explain the reason why, but she continued to talk over me and raised her voice louder. I asked her politely not to take that tone with me and attempted to explain that I had been waiting for over half an hour. Throughout this time it was quite clear that she was trying to fabricate and give the impression that an argument was happening- when there wasn‚Äôt. No matter what I tried to say she continued to shout at me. I asked her at one point to stop this but she carried on. The line then went dead. 

At no point was I rude or abusive to her or any other staff. When arranging the meters I spoke to a call centre which I believe to be somewhere in the Uk. However, my recent experience with this customer service centre has been horrendous. They are tricking your customers and chasing targets rather than helping people. 
I have lodged a formal complaint and will be looking at leaving them as soon as this is completed

Why have Edf customer services / complaints moved to an overseas call centre ! So now it makes sorting issues with readings and non working smart meaters twice as difficult ,

Absolutely diabolical. 

For starters, EDF completely messed up our meter readings. Then multiple advisors have ignored our request to add all tenants to our account (we‚Äôre professionals living in a shared flat where we all contribute to bills).

To top it off, they were supposed to install a smart pre-payment meter (so each tennant can contribute equally as and when). They instead installed a basic smart meter.

We‚Äôve spoke to various advisors and they have no idea what‚Äôs going on to be honest. 

It‚Äôs been over three months since we started a dispute and we have since received NO bill! People are moving out of the flat, the bill is going to be extortionate and left to the remaining people living in our house to cover. We should have resolved the situation when first disputing, but we now have no clarification that our bill will be corrected and then we will have ongoing months to pay at the same time. 

Have you heard there‚Äôs a cost of living crisis? 

I CANNOT tell you how much anxiety you‚Äôre causing us. I shall be taking this much higher if you do not contact me as soon as possible.

Your Customer Sevice Staff are Very Good on the phone but the Chat system takes hours and is inefficient.  All these people do is take the information and pass it on to management who do nothing.
Unfortunately your company is a computer which elderly folk like myself cannot deal with.
You are very clever at getting your customers to finance your business by your Direct Debit tactics. A budget account should go up & down but with your outfit the moment the account goes into debit you jackup the Direct debit to restore the account to credit.
If you want to borrow money you go to the bank but EDF use their customer credit balances to finance the business.  This is wrong.
I can unerstand why the salary of Financier CEO Simon Rossi is not available to the public domain.  This clearly is because it is so disgustingly high he does not want people to know.

Sorry to say I am having great problems with EDF at the moment. Long story short I had dual-rate tariff with old energy company, but moved to smart meter and single rate, but they went under before transition completed. EDF took over and continually tell me I have a dual-rate meter, which I've explained the situation countless times, but they are unable (or unwilling) to recognise the fact even though I've had engineers out saying I've got a single rate meter to accept it. I complained almost 4 months ago, but never heard back and when I phone up about this I get the usual ""we will the guy handling the complaint to message you"", but not heard anything. Management was meant to phone back, but never did. I am about to phone again since the person who was meant to phone yesterday never did. Awful company and been stressful since they also wanted to up my monthly debit to ¬£461 because of ""estimated"" readings from night-rate, which I don't have.

You refused to accept that you should have paid us our ¬£200 'off grid' payment.  After 20 days online exchanges and several WhatsApp posts, we made no progress, as the final post claimed once again we should claim on the government website.  On your website, very early in the text,  is the statement 'people should not normally have to claim as the utility company can confirm the requirement that customers have a utility contract.  An absolute shambles and a waste of our time.    We live in a small village which is totally oil based and the nearest gas is miles away.

EDF have been forcing to install a smart meter that I have never requested for. They have also been texting to inform that millions of customers who have converted to smart meters cannot be wrong. And as of my march bill on direct debit, It has been increased from ¬£210 a month to now ¬£322 a month. I live in a normal household and there is no one at home some days of the week. 
Prior to being automatically moved to EDF automatically when the company l was with went into liquidation about 2yrs ago. I used to pay just over ¬£150 a month. Soon after the move, I started paying ¬£210 reason being the Russian and Ukrainian war. But ¬£322 a month is such unjustified increase. 
Reading customer's experiences so far with EDF, l can relate how unreasonable they have been doing things. So far, their communication with myself has been quite undermining in tone. They seem to have already made the decision without my consent. They seem to work in ways that psychologically demoralise customers confidence. It is a shame that they are allowed to continue operating unlawfully in such a developed country.

EDF is completely incompetent.  Originally I was going to switch to them but then decided on EON who are excellent.

I emailed EDF on 8th February advising that I would not be switching to them.  On 9th February I received an email saying that the switch had been cancelled.  Clearly not as today they have switched from EON without my authorisation!

Now EON are having to raise an erroneous transfer to EDF which could take weeks.  They advised that we would not be cut off and once we are back with them they will update the billing.

EDF do not have my card number or bank details and no matter how many emails I send them including their CEO not one reply has been received.

I have now disconnected my smart meter so that they cannot obtain meter readings and I will not be paying them a penny.

I had a SMegs1 Smart meter installed by EDF in 2017. It stopped sending Gas reading back 2 years ago but still sends electricity. I complained to EDF back in 2021 and they gave me a ¬£50 credit but would not commit to when the problem would be resolved. This meant I had to manually send gas readings.

1 year later in May 22 I again raised the issue with EDF. They advised that they were still awaiting a fix and again would not commit to when I could expect a fix.

I then contacted the Energy Ombudsman looking for advice / support with EDF. They advised that EDF have until 2025 to resolve problems such as this i.e. over 4 years from the fault first being identified and reported. Total waste of my time. Toothless wonders !  Neither EDF or the Ombudsman will say where the problem is e.g. communication , software or hardware.

My IN-house display shows that my gas usage for February was ¬£28.84 when I calculate it myself it is over ¬£300. 

I am looking to install solar panels and would like the option to move supplier to take advantage of their more favourable export tariff.  Will another supplier take me on with my current Smart meter issues.

Had a smart PAYG gas meter installed on 7th February.  I was told it would take 14 days for the account to update from prepayment.  This never happened.  
I have called them about 12 times to try and sort this out and keep getting fobbed off.  I haven't been able to get anywhere with them, they're like talking to a brick wall.  They also lie, they promise callbacks, emails, responses and updates... not one person I have spoken to from EDF has followed through with this.  
I made formal complaint but this didn't make any difference and I kept getting given excuses that another teams deals with this, another team deals with that etc.  To top it all off today our gas supply got cut off. Nobody wants to take ownership of a problem and help you, they just keep passing the buck!  
The customer service (or should I say lack of it) from this company is absolutely appalling, staff don't communicate with each other and just try to get you off the phone when they realise that can't deal with / don't know how to deal with your problem.
I have asked to speak to a manager, however, I was told that I can't speak to one even after all of my phone calls, having been cut off from supply and the incompetence of EDF staff to resolve my issue. 
All this is after being an EDF customer for 15 years.  
This evening I have given up and signed up for another energy supplier.

I left EDF on 28th December 2023 , they asked me for final meter readings which I submitted with photos to prove the electric and gas was genuine,  from that point in time I have had nothing but problems.  They say the readings were incorrect,  they can't agree with the new supplier that the readings,  they ask me every time to send photos of the readings , I have sent on 5 occasions the photos,  so many calls that they can't confirm my account number,so many emails that get nowhere, so many chats that end up me pulling my hair out in frustration.

EDF is the worst shoddy and incompetent company that I have ever had to deal (read cursed) with! The words ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù and ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù do not exist in the company‚Äôs vocabulary. 

Since October 2022, I have spent several hours on the phone to EDF, more than once time 3 hours, trying to get a resolution to a problem EDF created in the first place, and to this day remains unresolved! I even managed to make, bake and ice a cake whilst on hold!

Whilst the fault is not clearly mine - my account fully paid up - I have received threats of legal action from EDF. I was very stressed and worried about this I have an excellent credit record and knew I didn‚Äôt owe EDF anything.

Where do I start with the story of the horrendous experience I have had at the hands of EDF, which helps itself to billions of our hard earned money every year?

Let‚Äôs me start with the beginning. 

At the end of September 2022, I phoned EDF to inform them that I had new tenants moving into a flat I rent out from 1 October 2022, and therefore my name should be removed from the flat account. One would have thought this would be a simple thing to do; but no! However, what EDF did was to:

1) Close down the account that I have with EDF for my personal residence, which has an address that is different address to the one I rent out; and
2) Open up a new account with the names of the two new tenants; but the supply address shown as that for my personal residence! 

I only got wind of EDF‚Äôs gross incompetence because my new tenants contacted me to say they were receiving bills for my address in their names! Both my tenants and I phoned EDF separately to advise them the accounts had been incorrectly set up. 

What should again have been a simple issue to resolve turned out to be an torturous and stressful experience. I spent several hours on the phone to EDF, on a couple of occasions up to 3 hours, and when I eventually got to speak to someone somewhere in South Africa, I was put on hold again for up to an hour, or after waiting for a long period, the call would just drop, and nobody would call me back despite promising to do so!

In the meantime, whilst all this was going on, EDF started to send me letters threatening legal action to both me and my tenants even though our bills were paid up.

Eventually, I managed to speak to someone who seemed to know what had led to the problem and she promised to rectify it. However, what she did was to open a new account in my name; BUT put me on a higher tariff of about ¬£750 a month! I of course took this up with EDF and they changed the tariff to what I had been on for some years ‚Äì variable and certainly much lower than ¬£750 a month! But EDF continued to send me letters demanding for payment and threatening legal action!

I decided to contact EDF‚Äôs CEO Simone Rossi, and I received an email from an ‚ÄúExecutive‚Äù who apparently had been assigned to resolve the problem. That was in November / December 2022 and I am still waiting to receive said ‚ÄúExecutive‚Äôs‚Äù response to my email.

In the meantime, EDF continued to send me thick wadded envelopes with legal threats for my bill for September 2022 to December 2022 even though I had made all payments to EDF in this period so owed nothing.

As an alternative to phoning, I tried using EDF's WhatsAPP and Chat services, which are both useless. I am sick of waiting for ""Enzo"", EDF's robotic agent to reply to me.
I also tweeted EDF and got a reply from ""Donna"" who asked me to DM her, which I did and to this day waiting for said Donna to reply to me. 
Last week I was narrating my horror story to a work colleague who advised me to contact the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) as she also had a traumatic experience with EDF. 

I phoned CAB who were brilliant. CAB have a special number to call EDF and their call was answered within the minute. I spoke to an EDF agent in the UK who seemed to grasp the problem and supposedly resolve the problem in about 10 mins. 
I say ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù because despite this agent telling me yesterday my EDF account was in indeed in credit, this morning when I decided to check my account because I do not trust EDF, I was horrified to find a demand saying that I owed EDF over ¬£700 for the period of September 2022 to December 2022. This is after the UK agent had told me yesterday that I was in fact in credit for this period!

So as I type, the problem created by EDF 5 months ago continues to remain unresolved. My heart goes out to the elderly and vulnerable who are at the mercy of EDF‚Äôs shambolic business. It is shocking that a company that helps itself to billions of our hard-earned money every year does have the decency to invest in a functional and decent customer service offering, telephony or staff training. 

Ofgem is no use as it is on the side of these shambolic energy suppliers. Enough is enough. These shambolic shoddy companies need to be brought to account. 
Whatever you do:

1) AVOID EDF LIKE THE PLAGUE!!
2) SCRUTINISE AND CHALLENGE ANY BILL YOU RECEIVE FROM THIS COMPANY AS THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED; AND 
3) MOST IMPORTANTLY, SET ASIDE A DAY TO WAIT ON HOLD IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT THIS INCOMPETENT AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY BY PHONE!

If I could give no stars I would. After being forced over to EDF as our previous supplier went bust, and we were given no choice. The switch over process took way to long and by the time it was complete no other company was taking new customers. EDF have been horrific from the word go, for a start 6 monthly billing in unacceptable, they are horrific at calculating monthly direct debit levels and accept no input form customers who know how much energy they use. The result is being hugely in credit every billing period so they are sitting on customer money which should be in customers accounts rather than theirs. Only response when you can finally get through is a standard patronising stock answer which suggests they have made correct calculations that will be reviewed every 6 months. Yet it is obvious they are not correct. Then the bills themselves, they are constantly refunding large periods and then recharging to distribute miss calculations throughout the year, resulting in incorrect charging at incorrect rates. I have no idea how they can still be operating and why anyone would stick with them. I can only advise everyone to leave them and move to a company like Octopus energy, as a complete drop of their services is the only way to force them to pick up their game and actually care about their customers. We are now in the process of moving to Octopus energy and the experience is already 100% better.

EDF will only review by billing arrangements every 6 months so basically it's total guesswork whether I will be in credit at the next bill date, or debit.

My electric smart meter has been down since June 2022, they finally came out last week 12-01-2023 to apparently fix it, they ended up mucking up my gas and now my smart meter doesn‚Äôt work for my gas or electric and I have to type to utrn code manually each time. I‚Äôve been doing this since June 2022 with my electric. I‚Äôve contacted them and they don‚Äôt care. So rude and such poor customer service. They don‚Äôt care at all

It's odd how I made a bad review about EDF on trustpilet and then I was removed from trustpilet. The truth makes no difference to these people. They do not want the truth to get out. I bet this review is not put out for people to read. EDF smart meters don't work.

Personally I have NOT had a problem with this company....except. Today I found out that I was in credit. Yipeeee. Mind you I'm not surprised because I've kept warm via hot H2O bottles, put my clothes for the following day beneath my bedding so they were warm in tut morning, cooked two meals at once in my oven, washed my cutlery with the ' still ' warm water from my hot H2O bottle...I've thought of everything. Can I reduce my D/D, can I get my credit back ...can I "" cook ""! With a F. 
Otherwise they are great.

The company is unavailable from a customer service perspective. They seem incapable of providing even basic responses and coherent conversations. Unintelligible english on whatsapp discussions that leave customers confused and unable to manage their spending. Customers are over charged through direct debits and requests to reduce them flatly denied without any genuine interest in the customers request. Automation and apps, without any half decent customer service skills.

Spent 2 hours 52 mins on Whats App trying to explain to agent that the ¬£199 Energy Support Scheme Payment paid into my bank account have been incorrectly treated as a refund from EDF! ¬£199 has been deducted from my credit balance i.e. wiping out the support scheme payments.
Agent had no idea how to handle this and despite my different examples/explanations, he repeated same lines.

Folks, what are we going to do about EDF ? People are being hurt, day in, day out - and it's getting worse. EDF shouldn't be allowed to run a company, full stop. Shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the public. We need a proper legal investigation into EDF. I have made 5 official complaints about serious EDF errors, and none of them have been handled. I've tried to contact EDF through every single avenue that's suggested, but nothing works.  I must have spent perhaps 500 [wasted] hours (so far) trying to deal with this company. Meantime I've been scammed by false EDF officials on the phone, and my EDF account has been hacked. I get shed-loads of EDF bills every darned week, and they're all wrong. It's total abuse. Has anyone found a way to solve this? I know a lot of people are getting harmed. Is it affecting your own health?

‚ÄúYou have taken an unauthorised payment of ¬£308.01. You tried to take this last month and after lengthy contact with your agents you advised it was an error and wouldn‚Äôt happen again.

I have contacted your call centre today, first time in hold for 30 mins. Agent advised he was refunding then disconnected me. I have his email contact. He did not attempt to call back.

I called again and was on hold for 40 mins. Agent advised he could not refund without a meter reading which he eventually obtained. This is completely irrelevant to the issue. He further advised he couldn‚Äôt refund without a manager and ALL of the managers were in a meeting. I used to be a complaint handler for a large company and occasionally this excuse was used there too so please don‚Äôt take me for an idiot. He could offer not help at all and put me on hold without advising me he was doing so.

On the call listening to the same soul sapping music for 1 hour and 20 minutes before a manager, Anna picked up, took details and again out on hold. Advised she has escalated to CEO office and will call back within 24 hours.

Omg...where to start!  This is the WORST company I have ever had to deal with.  
It doesn't matter what day you call, or when you call....the staff are rude, clearly hate their jobs, and take it out on the customer.
The wait message says there is a long wait, and it's not kidding.  Be prepared to sit for 45 minutes, on a good day.
The message tells you to be polite to their hard working staff....clearly a lot of irate customers.
They make MASSIVE profits, and don't put anything into their customer service, or their cracked and rusted nuclear plants.... a disgrace.

Octopus on the other hand..... Brilliant :)   A refreshing change, fast pick up, and the staff are friendly and polite.  Superb app.

Absolutely criminal! They are actually robbing scumbags!! They changed our tariff from ¬£200 to ¬£500 without even telling us.. Now we are in debt to other people we was paying money out to with a direct debit because we was unaware there were insignificant funds in our account. 
They chose to take out ALL of this money as a GUESS on how much we may pay now that its winter (Its been winter every year thanks very much!) Then i asked to change back to my old tariff - so they did (that was then recorded on my account) and then today 1st Dec - they chose to ignore ALL of that and take out ¬£500 again without telling us AGAIN! 
Another 2 hour telephone conversation later - they have said they cannot refund me i have to take to my bank.

he came on the phone literally crying to me saying he needs to sell the hotel because he cant afford the bills anymore from EDF,
I told him to send me the bill on whatsapp and to my horror it stated they were changing his monthly energy payment for the gas to ¬£3,651.00 he only opens at weekends.
He suffers from high blood pressure and if anything happens to him i will hold EDF totally responsible.
I then looked at his statements and found that has had 3 payments of ¬£1000.00 taken from his bank and 2 payments of ¬£495.00 taken from his bank and get this the credit on his account is ¬£3,250.66 and he has been on the phone three times to get this money back into his account and twice they put the phone down on him and the third time the line went dead.I am now going to seek compensation from this company for making my father ill and will be seeking legal advice from my solicitor.These thieves need to be held accountable life is hard enough with the energy crisis you dont expect energy companies to make it worse.

Horrible experience. I'm also sad to see so many other distressed people struggling to contact this really bad company. I've tried to engage with EDF via phone, text, email, letter - and this week even Facebook - but nothing works.  EDF makes vast errors.  There used to be a 'live chat' option where you could actually speak to an adviser in real time, but that seems to have gone?  They say they are 'overworked', overburdened with calls - all of which is very probably true - but in the meantime they threaten you, even though the mistakes are THEIRS.  They don't handle Complaints even if you escalate the matter. Thank God I refused a Smart Meter, thank God I refused a Direct Debit.. and so they can't get their claws into me that way. But they are telling me idiotic things e.g. according to them I supposedly used a colossal ¬£300+ of electricity in just 9 days in August 2022 [in that huge heatwave] when all my appliances were off!!! - however I live in one room, dear EDF??? ... but if I don't PAY UP by 4th December, they say they will damage my credit file!!!

I need to talk to you, EDF!!! My bill does not add up. I have done my sums and the ¬£141 credit balance should be ¬£347 credit balance.
I called 2 weeks ago and your team said I will be refunded (before I discovered I am owed more than I thought). I still have not received this (I mean MY) money.

Abysmal customer service. 35 minutes on hold to get told that I've come through to the wrong department so she'll put me ""straight through"" to the correct one. Instead she puts me back on hold for 20 minutes before I get cut off. So I call back and am on hold for 1 hour 18 minutes before the phone just cuts off. Possibly because it turned 6 o clock so screw everyone who has been waiting on hold. Called back today to wait 40 minutes before I could speak to someone. All of this to chase up something EDF should have done without any involvement from me. If you don't have enough staff to provide an adequate service then hire more staff - it's not rocket science! You've got enough money from robbing us all blind. Will definitely be changing if I hear of any company with decent customer service.

Just getting them to record the starting readings, after moving in really is hard work.

Each agent is either angry and wants to force you through a software driven process or end the call.
Or the worst is when an agent cannot enter the meter readings correctly, nor even the date...

Then getting it corrected is taking hours.

Terrible customer service - they all need a lesson in how to deal with people and how to give basic customer service.

I usually just ignore these little teething issues, but this actually appears systemic.
Three agents and all the same, incompetent or just too angry to help.

I used Telephone - min wait of 30 mins. WhatsApp, took days, still not got what I want; just record the information given...

I am at the point where I will write to the ombudsman for help!

Contacted via email was useless and WhatsApp took forever and kept being put back on the queue I gave up on 26th October and called the rudest person ever . Kept offering me a smart meter . All I want to do is set up a direct debit for the amount I owe currently &62.87 not for ¬£214 which is what EDF want to take each month .
Why is it so difficult for EDF to do this ?
My wi-fi provider can my mobile provider can so why can‚Äôt EDF ? 
How many peoples hard earned cash are they taking and earning interest on for their share holders ?

This lot are nasty. I see that you lot have problems with them too so I'm not wrong.
They are theives. Out of control. Lie and decieve and then call it misinformation... That's a classic narky trait, a trait I've dealt with alot over my years! 
Don't know what they're doing in their jobs and refusing to do their job/s properly and professionally!
Blaming. Rude. Time consuming. playing GOD. Fake. Generally a nasty experience and I think they enjoy being nasty, again another narky trait. 
So, if you are thinking of joining their agenda, then know that if they've done it to me, they Will do it to you. When I get the chance I'm leaving them, but at the moment they have a wicked hold over me with my money and my time and MY ENERGY.

I am disgusted with this company I have been promised ring backs so many times and wasted my time talking to advisors  who have never carried out what they promised to do .I have been left with so many problems because EDF have taken such large amounts out of my bank account after me sending emails not to .I have been left with no money to pay other bills and have bank charges because of no fault of my own .nobody listens or cares .my bank have been excellent and have refunded one of the payments for me but the next day EDF took it again saying they had sent me an email ...why didn't you respond to my watts app messages ?why didn't you reply to my e mails ?why have you taken large amounts of money without my consent after one of your advisors agreed for me to pay weekly amounts to clear my bill .I am totally shocked at your lack of care when so many of your customers are struggling you are definitely  making it worse for  everybody its a total disgrace that you are getting away with treating customers in should a terrible way .shame on you all ....you never ring back like you promise  to or respond to watts app messages  I have spent hours holding on the phone trying to speak to somebody .it has nis affected my health.

I‚Äôve been bullied and Harassed by EDF for the last  few months, I am a pensioner with Mental health problems and there debt collection company has sent me several demanding emails.
The strange thing is I‚Äôm not even an Edf customer which they now know, they have been looking into my complaint since the 30th of September and have just informed me it should be resolved by the 30th of November (61 days?) the company is a joke, they will no doubt respond to this apologising and saying this is not our normal standard but I know this is just another delaying tactic, come on EDF try explaining why you bully and harass old age pensioners.

Where do I start! Like many others I was moved to EDF. Never experienced anything like it. My account was in credit, received email saying my dd was being changed to ¬£2,685 per month. Nearly had a heart attack. Phoned customer service, their initial response was that‚Äôs a lot ! Before you think I live in a mansion, I live in a 3 bed semi detached. Spent 2 hours on the phone trying to sort it out, we a pensioners and don‚Äôt even receive ¬£2,685 a month. One agent told me I was below average usage, another told me I was above average usage! My direct debit was changed to 177 per month. After 6 months, which is way too long to receive accounts, I was ¬£1,200 in credit. They refunded me ¬£576 pounds. I didn‚Äôt want the refund, so I paid them back ¬£500. This is we‚Äôre the problem really gets interesting. My direct debit then increased to ¬£285 per month, so again I spent 2 hours on the phone asking why. I then agreed to pay ¬£200 per month, after much puffing and blowing I was told my monthly amount would be ¬£233 I asked why when I had agreed ¬£200 the reply was I would pay ¬£200 dd and the ¬£33 would come off my credit, by this time I was totally brain haggled! I didn‚Äôt argue any further,because I was banging my head against the wall. 2 days later I received email saying because I had ¬£500 in credit my dd was being reduced to ¬£2 a month I.e ¬£24 a year, another 2 hours on the phone, we agreed at the end of it to change it back to ¬£200. Still way too much. Checked my account no direct debit for September showing, back on the phone.  Apparently because I was ¬£500 in credit they didn‚Äôt take the money, but would start in October. I then asked to speak to someone who could explain how they worked dd out. After a lot of hot air being spoken, I was told I was paying too much, and would end up in credit! I have asked for a quarterly bill, which they have agreed to do but I am not holding my breath. I did ask if they had shares in mental institutions, because they are doing their best to make sure I end up being sectioned‚Ä¶..no doubt the saga will continue. I am definitely changing companies as soon as things settle down. Sorry this is so long..

EDF? I think they are an organised crime syndicate. They took over my supply when Green Energy went bust in May 2021. I left the rented propery in October 2021, supplied both gas & electric readings with photographic evidence and then received a final gas bill in November 2021 which was for gas only. contacted EDF. They said they would correct the error. December 2021 letter from EDF apologising for delay and as compensation would add ¬£30 credit to the account. This did not happen. December 20212 final bill came for ¬£14.53 but the electricity reading was 7311 estimated not the 6997 figure sent to them. Called EDF gave correct reading again, put the account on hold etc. Feb 2022 final bill from EDF. EXACTLY the same Start & Finish meter readings estimated but Final bill now ¬£533.88!!! Called EDF gave correct reading again, put the account on hold etc. March 2022 Same bill arrived again... Called EDF gave correct reading again, put the account on hold etc.
June 20 2022 Letter from EDF about ¬£533.58 unpaid bill now referred to a debt collection agency. Called EDF gave correct reading again, put the account on hold etc. June 23 2022 another final bill still with the wrong readings but now ¬£640.66 June 24 2022 Final Bill from EDF with the corrected reduced final lower meter reading but the bill increased by ¬£93.53 to ¬£734.19. Lodged complaint with the Ombudsman who so far agrees with EDF! I will see them in court!

Worst company I have ever dealt with.
I only wanted to convert my PAYG account for my gas to a credit account. Two weeks in and the smart meter hasn't been updated and nor has the online account activated. I've been on the web chat many times talking to several different agents, I've also called and waited to speak to someone. I'm only able to chase after them as I'm off work. All I was told is the account is in the process of being moved over and please be paitent or the call will be disconnected after 10-15 minutes. One agent said the smart meter is faulty so they have sent me a new smart meter which gives the same reading as the one I already have for a PAYG account. I'm guessing I'm going to have a sky high bill when they finally decide activate the account. The staff seem pleasant enough but always seem to fob you off with excuses. 
I wouldn't even bother with this company, they need to be investigated, stopped from trading and heavily fined.

I am someone who very rarely leaves reviews. But I was compelled to by the worst customer service team I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. It took me 8 phone calls to get through to an operator who would even check tariff's and the prices they could offer. This operator like the others on the team have a really unprofessional and rude tone, it's like no one has trained them to speak to customers. When the operator did finally check I was then told I had been given a standard tariff and had a 'complex' meter. I still don't understand what this means as the operator wouldn't explain it too me. I asked why she couldn't offer me prices, she explained that the complex meter team was a different department to the customer service team. I'm not sure why the system is this way as it seems overly 'complex' to me, pardon the pun. When I asked what to do next the operator bluntly replied 'contact the complex meter team'. I was shocked by this as it was so unhelpful with no explanation. I started to get cross as this point and then had to ask if it was even part of EDF? She replied simply with 'yes. Still being unhelpful and feeling like I was being blocked from trying to sort this I said very bluntly 'and how do I do that then? The operator explained she could pass my name on and they would hopefully contact me at some point but because it wasn't 'her' department she couldn't guarantee. This system seems shocking to me. This was Friday afternoon and as of Monday I still haven't received a call and in truth am not expecting one, so will be looking for a new energy supplier. If you enjoy long wait times and rude and unprofessional customer service then EDF is for you. But if you wish to be spoken to like a customer should be with some decency then do not use EDF. All of this without even mentioning the fact they charge more than a lot of other suppliers out there.

EDF worst customer service!!!
EDF have stolen ¬£882.64 
I have repeatedly had the phone put down on me trying to sort it out 
In my opinion I have been refused customer support and told I hade to wait 7 days until they can refund the money back into my account witch I could not do I had to get on the phone to my back and get them to get the money back with they did and was put back into my account the next day 
I‚Äôve also been put into financial difficulties as a direct result of your error 
I have since had a call from the your customer service manager 
What a joke
She said well now my moneys returning what‚Äôs the issue 
She was more interested in blaming me 
The biggest mistake I made was choosing edf 
This will all be broadcasted over social media to enlighten the world on the way you feel about customers 
She has clearly overlooked the fact that I‚Äôm only in this situation because you took to much money back in April 
Edf reps advised me to cancel the direct debit then refused to set it back up
Once this was rectified edf went on to take ¬£882.64 with out notify me of this payment witch left my account back account in Det 
I‚Äôm on edf‚Äôs system as vulnerable and also have 3 children here 1 is registered disabled 

I really expected to have a apology and a way of moving forward 
Instead I got a nasty piece of work whom didn‚Äôt care to even ask if my children had now eaten, or even if there‚Äôs now electric in the house 

Edf has caused this whole problem and then left me in a really hard position 
And then have been spoken down to by the customer service manager made me feel really stressed and embarrassed that I need the money that they took with out my permission back 

The worst customer service I have ever had to deal with and will be changing from edf

Avoid at all costs!!! 

In total I pay ¬£265.50 a month.

I have an instalment plan to cover arrears of ¬£600 (32.50 a month)

¬£233 budget direct debit for current usage.

I have letters and emails stating this too.

They left the arrears on my balance so my DD of ¬£233, has paid the arrears instead of starting my balance at 0 because the arrears have moved over to the instalment plan. 

I have explained this to 3 incompetent, rude and nasty people.

I was told I was wrong, They told me my usage is low so the direct debit was high to pay the arrears, my usage is high hence the high DD. 

Must be the worst company I have ever dealt with, they told me over and over how my DD has paid my arrears and that I can now cancel my instalment plan that I shouldn‚Äôt of been offered, I have explained so simply their error to no avail.

Now a 4th person has billed me until todays date (16/07/22) infact they have billed me until (22/07/22) 6 days in the future? They said they have reduced my DD which I didn‚Äôt want to do but in fact they have raised it to over ¬£340 and my instalment plan is still active too (again for arrears I‚Äôve already paid)

Instead of returning my account balance to ¬£1165 (¬£233 x 5) and continuing the instalment plan of ¬£32.50 which I have a whole email stating the payment dates they have continued the instalment plan, and billed me 6 days into the future so I‚Äôm now in ¬£658 debt as well as still owing the ¬£600 previous debt.

EDF energy is the worst electricity company ever. Customer service was irresponsible and the charge was ridiculously high. My bill went up to 1500 per month when I live in a small flat and basically go out and work all the time. I talked to the customer service and requested a check to the meter. They told me to send them pictures of meter in the next seven days. I did it asap, but I NEVER had an answer after all after 6 months. I contacted EDF team for at least 6 times in the past 5 months to beg an answer. Every time they said they will deal with it but NEVER update me with the process besides sending me final notice.

This morning was the final straw when they took out over ¬£800 out of my account, baring in mind they took out last months DD at the end of the month at a tune of ¬£240. It‚Äôs now the 4th July and this happened? No warnings, it‚Äôs not even my DD date. I have now cancelled my direct debt, why?

At a recent annual service of my central heating I was informed by the engineer that he could not complete the service as he was unable to take a reading from the gas meter due to condensation occluding the read area. I was instructed to report the problem to my provider EDF which I did immediately using the 'chat' facility. The agent I spoke to informed me that he would report the problem and someone from EDF would get in touch. A couple of weeks passed and the expected contact failed to transpire. I then emailed the company customer service department and explained both the problem and the lack of initial response. The reply to my email stated that someone from EDF would be in touch within the next ten working days. Needless to say that after three weeks there had been zero contact. I emailed again and the reply stated that someone from EDF would be in touch within the next five working days but once again after several weeks had passed there was still no contact. I emailed again showing that I was extremely dissatisfied with the company customer service and so far there has been no reply. Hardly surprising that there are so many negative reviews of EDF.

When the person went to check my flat, everything that I left in the fridge and freezer so that I had food after the trip was wasted. I tried to contact them to reconnect my electricity as we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to do it without electricity in my flat!, they could offer me a solution, at the end we had to unplug the meter and plug it at the communal area so it would work and it finally did. After the offered me ¬£20 as if all the trouble and all that I had lost was worth that. I wish I could change company but I can‚Äôt. Until now my smart meter is still not working, every time I have to top up, I have to do it manually after.

Was changed to EDF, without being consulted, when Green Network Energy folded. Was promised that my contract and direct debit from Green Network would be honoured, it wasn‚Äôt and my DD  went up from ¬£65 to over ¬£140 I complained and EDF drooped it down to ¬£90. I find the bills extremely hard to understand as they cover 6 months at a time. I am in debit of ¬£58, bearing in mind we are now starting summer and the bills will be smaller, and EDF have tried to increase my direct debit to ¬£185.00 per month without informing me. After I complained they reduced it to ¬£100 pm. I can‚Äôt help thinking that this company that was foisted on me is bordering on dishonest, as they took over my account without my instruction and have the nerve to say there is a cancellation fee of ¬£35 each for gas and electricity. I dread to think what tricks EDF will get up to when the threatened increased cost of gas and electricity comes into place.

No customer services, just robots and chat assistants. why do they think that typing is better than speech??? Just like supermarket self checkouts, they create queues and not solve them. The backlog of customer dealings must be through the roof.
They are owned by the french government as well so an even better reason to stay away. Anti british utilities they should be called.

If I could give no stars I would.
I've had to battle with EDF for several months now as their system kept ignoring my correct meter readings and issuing bills based on their own much higher 'estimated readings' for my electricity, although they seemed to be perfectly ok with my gas ones - they blamed it on an ongoing system fault, but then confirmed that they use the same system for both fuels so work that out if you can!!
Finally, after 6 long arduous calls and almost as many incorrect bills being issued I found someone who seemed capable of sorting it out.
However I've just checked the detail of my recent bill and its obvious to me that the gas standing charge has been charged twice on consecutive invoices for the same period, so I've rung them yet again this afternoon.
The 'go to' solution for the customer service advisors currently seems to be that when they can't work out how to fix the problem they just cut you off......it's happened twice this afternoon - so I've now spent the best part of an hour on the phone going through the all same details twice and still EDF have money of mine that they shouldn't have charged me in the first place.
Even better, it seems that you can't make a complaint unless you have a 'complaint reference' and surprise surprise, the first time I got cut off was when I asked the girl to raise the charge as a complaint as she was insistent I hadn't been overcharged, even though I was sitting looking at it in black and white on their invoices which I'd printed off and had in front of me!!
So EDF....if you are reading these reviews.....how do I get back the money you have seemingly overcharged me?????

One week ago I got in touch with EDF to arrange moving a meter to coincided with moving my mains power with UK power, which is tomorrow. It took EDF an entire (week with me reminding them most days) to come back and tell me that they couldn‚Äôt move the meter for another two and a half weeks. This means I am going to be totally without power for half a month! My electrician,  who is a fully registered electrical engineer said he would be happy to come along tomorrow with UK power to move it (it‚Äôs only moving to the other side of the same wall!) but EDF won‚Äôt give permission for him to do that. They would rather their customer have no power for two and a half weeks. My house has no gas supply, so this means no heating. EDF haven‚Äôt tried to get an earlier appointment for me due to my extenuating circumstances. I‚Äôm appalled at the lack of effort to try and help a customer in need. And this is a company that overcharged me last year because of a faulty meter!!!! Do I have to move it myself?  because I can‚Äôt be without power for two and a half weeks!!  Acc: 671 147 918 280

I find 1 star even too generous! The worst customer service I‚Äôve ever heard of. 

Can‚Äôt believe the hassle I have been having. It‚Äôs draining and so stressful! 
Edf tried to give me ¬£50 credit on my meters without fixing my issues! And then asked me what do I want from them‚Ä¶.. I am absolutely shocked, I want the issues fixed! 
They are liars and have disgusting customer service skills. 
I was on pay and go by choice, so I don‚Äôt get hit with a massive bill one monthly and can keep track on my spending. My smart meter isn‚Äôt working, my online account doesn‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt get balances. This was happening for over a month. I had to ring up to find out what was wrong and didn‚Äôt get any notifications of my meters ‚Äúupdating‚Äù as they said. 
They said to switch to monthly bill whilst it gets fixed, so I agreed as I suffer with mental health issues and it would help for the time being. 
Now they changed it all, they think it‚Äôs all sorted and want to close my complaint. When I still have issues :/ 
Can someone please explain how a monthly payment /meter can cut supply saying ‚Äúno credit left‚Äù. This is not right! And they lied saying it shows it‚Äôs fine. 
I send pictures and video proof, had no reply for 6 days and then got told the issue is fine. When it‚Äôs still the same. I follow their instructions and nothing works. And the get lied to even more saying they sent me messages on a date when I had nothing from them, and sent proof of that and they insured I was incorrect. 
How can a company call a customer a liar when we have actual photographic and video proof?! 
They think that throwing ¬£50 as a ‚Äògesture‚Äô at people will shut them up. And then say ‚Äúwe have done everything what do you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are going to close the complaint‚Äù ‚Ä¶.. I don‚Äôt care about the money they are trying the throw out, I‚Äôd rather they not lie and actually fix the issues and take responsibility.

EDF has been sending a representative to read my meter over the past year but continued to do estimates. I put in a complaint March 7th 2022 at the beginning my complaint was being replied to but since April 12th they have been ignoring my emails. Since these emails I have had a threatening letters as due to this they had put me in debt.
I am now going to the ombudsman and ofgem. This is now the second time I've had to go to the ombudsman, the first time EDF were charging me for someone else's meters and even after showing picture proof and video proof of my meters I still got called a liar.

EDF have ignored most of them, and when I have had replies it has been nothing to do with my complaint or give me any conclusion.

Yesterday 18/5/2022 I received an email stating my complaint has been closed and I would need to confirm all my details yet again to reopen another complaint. I know why EDF have closed this complaint its to try and stop me being able to put my case to the ombudsman, well that is not going to happen.

Total joke, in Jan 2022 they wanted to bump my DD from ¬£64 to ¬£189! I live in small flat with 2 rooms, so they use a gas estimate;heaven knows how they work that out! Anyway got in touch with real reading(my leccy is smart meter) My account was over ¬£400 in credit, they left my DD the same, raised a complaint about the estimates, here is the latest email from them.
""Thank you for your email.




I can confirm I have got an electric reading from your meter of 7328 and the gas reading you input as 6674.




I have billed both of your accounts today and can confirm the outstanding balance is ¬£475.53, the reason this is high is because you received a refund into your bank on the 9 February 2022 of ¬£398.52 in error. The reason this was refunded is there was a credit showing on a gas only bill which was issued on the 1 February 2022 with no electric being charged on the bill. Had this refund not been issued you your balance would have been today ¬£77.01 in debit.




I am sorry this has not been explained to you previously however, this money would need to be paid back to EDF as refunded in error or alternatively we can arrange for an instalment plan to be set up to help clear the balance over a period of time. If this is something your looking to do please let me know.""

So they failed to bill me at somepoint for leccy which made my account credit which I asked for refund for, and now they say it was an error on their part and want the money back!

Also my smart meter reading for leccy has jumped from about 4400 to over 7300 in 5 months! Am hardly at home to use my leccy unless my wee dog is having a party when am not there!

They have a duty to supply accurate bills; anyone has an issue with EDF or any other provider get on to Ofgem, I am not letting this go! Robbers!

An utter fraudulent scandal of an energy supplier. Make up estimated bills, despite supplying accurate meter readings, lie to the Electricity Ombudsman when raising complaints against them and completely mess up every single thing they do. Ripped out a perfectly adequate working economy 7 meter (and then denied it was an economy 7 meter and tried to charge me for a ""standard tariff"" meter), and botched the smart meter installation, still have not admitted for any mistakes or apologised once for anything they have done wrong. If I could get away from them, I would, but they keep making up bills to deliberately put the account into dispute. When you put a negative review on Trust Pilot it either disappears or is deliberately deleted after 1-2 months, hence why Trust Pilot has become a joke.

I've had an ongoing issue dating back to last year. 

I have given EDF gas meter readings every month yet they have not updated and keep billing based on estimates. I have tried to update my gas meter readings myself close to 10 times but it is lower than the previous bill and the dashboard wont accept it. Even though this is their fault for failing to take my meter readings from me. I have tried to call, email, and chat them on the website with evidence outlining this. No one has got back to me. I have even raised 3 complaints to their complaints email and nothing back.

The same issue happened the previous year and took 4 months for me to resolve for which they promised me a ¬£50 goodwill credit (this has not been applied or it has been applied yet)

I have tried to contact Silindelokuhle Mhlongo numerous times for help which she promised I could upon resolution of the original complaint, but have just been ignored. Emails are being read as I am receiving read and open receipts.

I have called a total of 34 times, most recently today with an average wait time of 47 minutes, spoke to one lady, was put on hold again with no warning, and then hung up on me. I have been hung up on a total of 16 times.

I also find it humorous that a big energy company that talks about sustainability would waste so much resource in sending repeated paper letters to my house every day when they could just check their email and call me once to resolve. 

They have now started to receive threats to my credit report about the bill, HOWEVER THE BILL IS INCORRECT.

They have the WORST customer service, they can barely speak english, and when they don't know what to do they just hang up haha. You'd think a company that now holds somewhat of a stronghold over the market would throw more resource from the increase in gas prices and decrease in competition towards employing ample satisfactory staff to service their increase in customers

I have tried to update my gas meter readings myself but it is lower than the previous bill and the dashboard wont accept it. Even though this is EDFs fault for failing to take my meter readings from me. Please see evidence attached.

They also offered ¬£50 goodwill credit for staying because they mishandled my account. This has not been applied or it has been applied but has been removed on subsequent bills

I have exhausted every avenue with customer support yet have had ZERO response, yet daily reminders via txt, email, and physical mail to pay a false bill.


I have tried to contact Silindelokuhle Mhlongo numerous times for help which she promised I could upon resolution of the original complaint, but have just been ignored. Emails are being read as I am receiving read and open receipts.

EDF are a bunch of con artists. Twice now, they have conveniently changed my bill after me contacting them to say that they had overcharged me. The last time, after a month of fighting, they finally cleared my balance to ¬£0 and gave a credit of ¬£25 as ""goodwill"" for all the stress they caused. However, on my latest bill they have added on the money they claim I didn't pay, which they waived. And now they have faked a bill to make it seem like I still owe them! It's not enough that they make record profits, then put up prices to an extortionate level, but they also try to scam us out of our money too. 
The customer ""service"" is atrocious. I've had to ask 5 times to have my complaint escalated to a manager and they still won't do this. I have never been so disgusted by a company and the way they try to screw hard working people out of their hard earned money.

My whole experience with EDF has been a nightmare. They took over GNE who has made some mistakes In billing. I appreciate there will be issues. 

However I gave them all the correct information numerous times. I was then told my monthly debit was increasing from 99 pound to 617pound, and I owed 1600 pounds. They kept estimating my electric usage to 4x what I used and gas to 3x the amount. When showing them correct figures they kept doing the same. It took 6 months to resolve. Over 30 hours of waiting on phone calls, being hung up on by rude incompetent staff and writing emails. I revieved letter after letter causing stress as I could not afford this stupid figure they made up. 

When I eventually did the work for them and raised it to the CEO team they even initially tried scamming more money. When back calculating costs I owed, they were using the inflated price per unit of today's date which was more than double that I used at the time (BE CAREFUL AND CHECK WHAT YOU ARE PAYING) finally they admitted I owed 300 pound and my monthly debit was 117 pounds. After 6 months of my time I managed to fix it. 
They do not value thier customers at all, they arranged dates and times to call back so I would be able to answer as I work shifts and would never call, thus wasting more of my time. Absolute joke regarding thier customer service.

I switched to EDF from Bulb in November 2021 as Bulb were in trouble. I never had any problems with Bulb. I was quoted ¬£58 monthly for a 1 bed flat which was reasonable. I paid 2 months at ‚Ç¨58 then was told from January 2022 I would be paying ¬£91 monthly. I was not happy with this so switched to Scottish Power. After paying 3 months at ¬£58 (¬£174 ) I have received a final bill for ¬£309 (including ¬£100 each for electricity and gas early cancellation fee). They have also grossly overestimated my gas reading. I have contacted them to complain and they will not change the final bill. This  means I have paid Edf ‚Ç¨483 for 2 months supply. DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!!. I am 73 and on a pension and when they take this ¬£309 from my account thisthe next  week I will have little money left for the next 2 weeks. Do not go to EDF as they will rob you blind.

Received fairly strong letters from EDF  threatening to move me from my fixed tariff  if I didnt get a smart meter installed. Both my husband and I work full time and there were no weekend appointments available for a fitting for as far forward as their appointment system allowed so husband took a days holiday. I had to provide EDF with the phone number of the person who was going to be at home so gave them my husband‚Äôs. He received numerous texts in the days leading up the appointment as a reminder. Engineer was supposed to come between 8-12 am and call 30 mins before he arrived, but no one called or appeared . At 1 pm husband called the company and after holding for 30 mins no one would speak to him as the account was in my name. They were happy to send numerous texts but wouldn‚Äôt speak to him to explain why no one arrived. I couldn‚Äôt call as i was at work. They told him someone would call the house the following evening at 6.30pm but no call . They called the night after and offered no explanation as to why no one turned up. We offered them 10 new weekday dates that someone would be at home for installation  but they could not accommodate any of them. They said the engineer arrived but could not get access. Absolutely rubbish, my husband was at home the entire day. We asked them to provide details of the telephone call or arrival time , they could not provide any of these details. They ended up telling us to call again in 6 months to get a new appointment as they have nothing. No offer of any compensation  until we pushed for it  at which time they offered ¬£40 for our inconvenience.
 Terrible company as soon as our fixed tariff ends I will be moving. Only with EDF as previous supplier went bust.

In short I would pay more not to be with EDF. Customer service cut you off after waiting on hold for 30+ mins. I was told on two separate occasions that my power would come back on and I would be phoned back within that hour - nothing happened. It then took me six hours to get a member of staff to move me onto Direct Debit for electricity to be greeted by mail in the post saying that I was set up for Pay as you go. I have never experienced such a bad service, I genuinely cannot believe how bad my experience has been with EDF. As soon as the issues with price caps are over I am going to move straight away even if it costs me more. I would pay more not to be with EDF.

Disgusting company. They are taking ¬£388 a month (more than my mortgage) for Gas & electric. I live in a 3 bedroom end of terrace house. I'm self employed, they are actually taking food from my children's mouth. I've never missed a payment of any bill of my home since 2008 and always paid full amount. I've not had the heating on for 2 years. I've even made the home smart by installing smart bulbs everywhere to reduce cost. They also bullied me into installing a smart meter which I did to help, but every few month they just keep taking more and more, I've even explained I'm classed as a vulnerable adult. At this rate they will make me and my family homeless. What am I doing here - powering up a nuclear power plant!

I have had three smart meter installation appointments .
First one left me without power for nearly two hours as when the meter was installed the DCC , whatever that is was down and the guy had to reinstall the old meter.
Second installer said there was no point as the gas meter was too far away from the electric meter.
Third attempt was cancelled by EDF with no explanation. 
I made a complaint and EDF seem more interested in closing the complaint than actually resolving it. 
Will definitely not be going with EDF when my current tariff expires on gas and electric. 
Given that EDF are bragging about their smart meter installation I find it a total lie and would not recommend to anyone.

These big companies just feel like they can do what ever they want, and the truth is they can if you stay with them.

I told them there was no issues whatsoever before they came. Long story short they left my house with no electricity freezing cold no heating and no shower. 

Next time a big company tell you they want to come around and check things tell them to get a letter from the court, this will waste there time and money like they have done with me.

The worst experience ever. I asked to have the smart meters installed and the engineer advised me not to top up until the meter was fully installed and confirmation was received via text. Confirmation never arrived and now I have had no gaz supply for two days now because apparently he made a mistake and I was supposed to top up.
The chat on the website was rude and unable to help, they have me a number to call for emergencies. The associate over the phone tried to do something but eventually told me that an engineer was needed to open the valve and that I was unable to top up. She was supposed to call today at 6pm to arrange the visit. Of course she called at 5 pm and I could not pick up the phone.
Back to the emergency number, after 4 hung up calls (what an irony, no one had a stable line) they gave me another emergency number to call. This is the second day without gaz supply for an error I haven't made and NO ONE CAN FIND A SOLUTION.

I have honestly never received such terrible customer service in a long time. Sent bills that change constantly, unable to get any response from calls or whatsapp messages, told wait 28 days for a response, my account being deadlocked and told to go to ombudsman. I have written to CEO and this is a copy:
 Dear Mr Rossi
I am writing to tell you how badly I have been treated by your customer service, which has got to be one of the worst I have dealt with in a very long time.
It started when EDF offered to put in a smart meter. My gas meter is an a very dark space under stairs and very hard to get to and because I had an inhome display for my electric I thought this would be great to help me read the meter for my gas and told your staff that.
On 24th August I have the new meter fitted, the engineer was abrupt and rude, saying things like ""I would be ok if I didn't have to climb into small spaces like this to do my job"". He asked for my in home display (from another company) looked at it and says to me ""in an hour or so, you will see a little gas flame appear and that will be your gas account working"".
2 days pass and no little gas flame.
This is where the problems start. I will not bore you with the amount of calls I have made, I am told things like, wait 28 days and it will appear and sorry no one is available to help and basically they have no idea!!! I start looking on the internet and these in home displays are pretty bad for most companies and dont seem to work well, however, alongside this my electric deal with Octopus is coming to an end, so explain to EDF that once this problem is all sorted out I shall look at transferring as you were offering the best rate.
FINALLY on 15/9 after being on hold with Rebecca (wont give last name) she is the first person in 6 weeks to mention that I don't have electric with EDF and there is no way my gas in home display will work if I have 2 separate companies providing ,my utilities......ARE YOU JOKING!!! I have spoken to so many members of staff, told to take pictures of my meter (had to get next doors kid to come and take it as I was unable to get in the space). I am soooo annoyed this has been an utter joke, wasting so much of my time and EDF's staff.
As this has taken so long I have now reached the point where gas an electric have gone up so much my initial quote to change electric to you as well, the unit rate has doubled!!! This means I can not leave EDF as my gas charges are locked till end of 2023, so to leave your company now would cost me ¬£100's.
I have not really explained my case to you properly as there has been soooooooo many calls, so much time and money wasted, when if your staff were trained properly, when I called on 26th August, they would have told me ""in house meters do not work for gas if you do not have the electric with the same company."" I would have been in the same position now, not being able to read my meter at all and would have secured a better 3 year electric deal.
In conclusion, your customer service is terrible, the last letter I got from Gabrielle Bell in complaints, basically telling me there is nothing they can do have dealocked my account and I should call the ombudsman tipped me over the edge. I tried calling back most day and whatsapping your company, but have been totally ignored. Today I am totally defeated by your company and breaking down to your staff member, it has caused me so much distress. I have been thrown ¬£50 to go away and shut up.

Terrible company with terrible customer service needs negative stars. Several years ago they fitted a smart meter for us and didn‚Äôt charge for 6 months over winter when we heavily use gas because we have a big area to heat, and countless times when I got in touch to ask to pay something I was told I couldn‚Äôt as our meter wasn‚Äôt showing. A young family, 2 relatively small incomes and hit with a bill of ¬£876.01, whilst then also being expected to pay a monthly amount towards current billing.

At every step of the way my personal circumstances have been ignored, every request has been ignored. I asked if I could be forewarned of any changes to my direct debit as it kept jumping up to really unmanageable amounts but every single time there was no warning it came off and then I got an explanation. Then I had to battle to get it back down to an amount of could afford including both a monthly payment and a debt repayment. And I‚Äôve been stuck in this cycle ever since. We haven‚Äôt missed a payment up until this month when I‚Äôve decided enough is enough.

Then this summer we both lost our jobs under really distressing circumstances which only added to the pressure, and once again, our direct debit jumps up without warning. Thank goodness we are so skint it didn‚Äôt come off it was an obscene amount to be expected to pay monthly.

Several times when I have pushed back with customer service about our usage, explaining I know it‚Äôs high but it‚Äôs not that high, they have changed their tune and amended the amounts. Total crooks exploiting the poor.

I have tried to move away several times and been blocked every time. I would have taken my debt away to another company to be repaid if I could have just to get away from dealing with EDF but I was told this was not an option.

I borrowed money to pay off all of the outstanding payments so I could move to my chosen provider this month who I already use for electricity and they have been fantastic (Bulb energy), but once again it has been blocked. Even after the EDF complaints team ‚Äúassuring‚Äù me this wouldn‚Äôt happen. Totally unacceptable!

I have been suicidal over this situation. Which sounds ridiculous because it is a gas bill. But that is how much stress it has caused and I have felt completely trapped. And when I told EDF all this it was brushed off. I will do everything in my power to get justice here and ensure that nobody else is treated with such contempt.

I really hope this company is humbled and brought to the ground.

I was on a fixed price tariff. I stopped my existing direct debit of ¬£46 per month after I get a message saying they were raising it to ¬£126 per month and I was unable to contact anyone. 

Eventually it gets resolved and EDF say they have set up a new direct debit, they send me conformation of this, however they never took the money from my bank, I then get threats to settle the outstanding debt which I did. I then get notified that as I had paid my account in full my fixed price tariff was cancelled. And I should set up a new deal at a much higher price.

I have tried contact by post email and whatsapp.
 
Only reply I got was they did not like my language, I called them Bloody Incompetent, in my correspondence with them. 
By the way they are. I will be going to the ombudsman.

My mother, 83 in a one bed flat was emailed a very high bill based on an 'estimate' from Green Energy. This was way over her regular and current usage. Efforts to represent her on the phone were obstructed because, even when she gave her permission for me to speak on her behalf, they first refused to provide any evidence that she had used the electricity of a small business and then simply did not ring me back on the third and fourth occasions. 
At least there is a strange comfort in reading so many bad reviews, even if EDF don't care.

Extremely poor customer services, I m surprised they are allow to do business in the U.K. They never follow through what they agree to do. I had numerous issues with meter reading when I moved to my currently address, they were constantly overcharging and ignoring the reading.It took 3 months and I m still not sure if it accurate. Then I called to say that my old flat will be empty and I wanted to reduced to direct debt, yes they said - new agreement was sent etc, they still continue to take the same direct debt, even though I have a smart meter in that flat they keep telling me asking me to send a meter reading. I asked them to change my email account so I could set up online account, - yes we can do that for you Mr. ‚Ä¶. Guess what? Still not done.

Poor from start to finish. I was always largely in debit no matter what season; I didn‚Äôt accrue enough credit over the summer months to make winter payments more manageable despite paying an additional amount at the end of the Winter season. Just four months after paying this to settle my account, I was over ¬£400 in debit again (this time for the Summer months!?)

They provided plenty of jargon to explain and have a very complicated billing system. A means to be dishonest, I‚Äôm convinced.

After a few years of this, I decided to move to another provider and won‚Äôt ever go back!

Whatsapped them 4 times to ask them to change my meter from the current incorrect estimation.

EDF have overcharged me by approx. ¬£2,000 over the past 18 months. They then pushed me to making a Complaint to the Ombudsman Service who have upheld EDF's actions as Condition 3.5 of EDF's Terms & Conditions state; ""Where we are entitled to change the conditions of your contract, this includes the right for us to change your product or the way you pay and how often you pay."" Be very careful of the small print in the EDF Terms & Conditions as the Ombudsman will not find against them due to this clause.

Both my Electric and Gas are with EDF and in January I was recommended by an adviser to set up a Direct Debit for both as it would make my monthly bill more predictable. I agreed and arranged for it to be setup. I was told the first direct debit payment would be taken in 3 weeks in line with the date I get paid. 5 weeks later I called and said nothing had been taken and was receiving letters to say I needed to make payment and I was overdue. I was told there had been an error and it was not successfully setup and it would be amended immediately. I paid upfront the overdue amount and accepted it was a one off error. The payment date came around again and once again the DD was not taken. I rang again was told there was a bug in the system and once again the DD had not been successfully setup (again no contact to let me know this had not been done). By this time my bill had gone up so I once again setup the DD and as-well as that I had to setup a payment plan for the overdue amount which I could not afford to pay at once. I was given as a good will gesture of ¬£30. Finally I received email notification to say the DD had been setup and thought that was the last of it. 

Then at 12am in the morning at the end of May I received an email to say my DD for my Electric had been successfully setup. I immediately called to say this is a mistake as it was setup 3 months ago. I was then told that I 
Unfortunately my 3rd attempt to set the DD had not been successfully and nothing had been taken for almost 3 months. I then almost cried as I live on my own and all I was thinking was how am I going to pay up the arrears. I had received no email or letters to say my payment had not been received and when you setup a DD you have to wait every 3 months to get a bill breakdown and you can no longer view the balance owed on the app. 

I couldn‚Äôt believe I had not received confirmation of setup without even a curtsy call to let me know for the 4th time my DD had not been taken. At this point i needed EDF to accept the multiple errors made on their end and write off the 3 months of DD payments I was now behind on (not including the arrears I was paying because of the 2nd and 3rd time this had happened). Instead I was offered a ¬£50 goodwill gesture which they seemed and I quote

  ‚ÄòWe have apologised, taken the correct    actions to fix things and offered an appropriate level of goodwill‚Äô 

Again I have been a loyal customer for 10years since being 18 and they do not understand what 3 months of arrears does to my mental health as I now over hundreds of pounds of debit to worry about. 

I said ¬£50 did not seem fair with the extent of what had happened. All I‚Äôve tried to do is be smart and setup a DD. To which point they sent me a letter to say they will offer nothing more and attached a option to contact the Ombudsman. 

I would recommend making sure all DD are setup by checking with your bank as if I had never received the midnight email I would still be thinking payments were being taken. 

I am so disgusted with the way I have been treated. Cold and no compassion to set things right. I will now be be cancelling the DD which I don‚Äôt trust and think about what other bills I will have to miss to try an catch up

am absolutely appalled by EDF. I switched energy suppliers in April, and had to chase up the final bill 3 times. I ended up paying two suppliers in 1 month which left me massively short of money and I am a full time carer for a disabled child. I was told contradictory things on the phone by customer services. I was promised call backs which were either late or never materialised. My bill showed credit and they denied they owed me money. I took it to the complaints team and they would not give me the credit I believed they owed me. I was promised a phone call back about compensation from the customer service team and they never called back. Complaints team said I didn't qualify for ¬£30 compensation because I'd only been waiting 5 weeks for my final bill, not 6. Caused me a huge amount of stress. They're a huge corporate company, making millions, and represent capitalism at its worse. No not use. Awful.

To be one of the top six all I can say is this. The customer service is shocking. Blunt to the point of ignorance, not helpful in the slightest and quite frankly unable to answer the simplest of questions such as what our usage was from the 5th - 17th of the month. 

I was asked to give meter readings, which I did. The account was discussed with myself. He they said sorry your name isn't on the account so I cannot give you them. So my partner spoke on the phone as her name is on the account. He then said I can't give you them as the account is due to be switched. 

They genuinely don't seem to have a clue. Which explains the 1.5 star rating. 

They was our supplier on the new property we moved into and can happily say I am switching back to our normal supplier being               
 ""People's energy""

Far better customer service, always manage to answer or explain your question and by far a hell of a lot cheaper.

One error after another when switching.
First misinformation about mt tariff....discussed it with them and that looked to be resolved.
I registered with their priority service department and informed them that obtaining meter readings would be near to impossible for me (due to where my gas meter is located it would involve me crawling along the floor)

My switching date was the 12th April and they requested opening meter readings, which with much difficulty I obtained and entered on my account. Last week I noticed a message on my account stating I did not enter my opening readings and the time to do this had expired and they would use estimated reads. Due to my anxiety I can't cope with these changes, so I contacted EDF and their live chat person said they were going to sort it. When I logged in later that day it was asking me for opening reads again. I contacted EDF and was told to ignore that as my switch was not complete and someting had gone wrong. This really set my anxiety off so I contacted their complaints department and was told they WERE using the reads I gave them on the 12th and everything was going as it should.
Saturday (24th) I logged in and noticed it again said I was too late in giving my opening meter reads, as they were closed I initially shrugged it off and trusted what they said thet they were using the reads I gave. BUT then on the 25th I got a notification from my previous supplier that my final bill was ready and upon checking this I noticed they did use estimated reads.
This caused such an anxiety reaction I had to take strong medication and it caused severe worries.
This morning I made EDF aware of all this and to say they could care less was an understatement.
They did not care at all about how they caused me 2 anxiety attacks, nor the physical pain they caused in obtaining their meter reads. Why do this if you are not going to use the reads. All they come up with is that the reads are within the acceptable tollerance, interestingly the reads are in THEIR favour, with a higher unit cost than my previous tariff.
If it was up to me I would leave EDF straight away.
If you have any disability do yourself a favour and stay away.

EDF, your company is a disgrace. My smart meter stopped working in July 2020. I called, WhatsApp messaged and emailed you numerous times before finally getting a new display, however this didn‚Äôt solve the problem so I had to get back in touch, this time I was told it was part of a known technical issue and you were dealing with it. I hadn‚Äôt heard back for another few weeks so had to get in contact with you once again, this time I raised a complaint. I was told that you could not give me a date when this would I be resolved. In December I received a call from a manager, I requested that he waive the exit fees on my tariff so that I could leave EDF, he asked if I could be a bit more patient and told me that once the complaint was resolved i would receive ‚Äòsubstantial‚Äô compensation. I agreed to this expecting a resolution in the next couple of weeks, however again I heard nothing so I emailed to ask the progress and I was told you couldn‚Äôt tell me when you could solve the problem and offered me ¬£35 compensation, this would leave me with ¬£5.00 after taking into account my ¬£30 exit fee, I replied saying I was told the compensation would be substantial and I didn‚Äôt think ¬£35 was. You agreed to increase it to ¬£50, again after taking off the exit fees I would be left with ¬£20, I don‚Äôt know what you class as substantial but I certainly don‚Äôt think this is! Today I received a ‚Äòdeadlock‚Äô letter advising you would not be offering me any more and I would have to raise the complaint to the energy ombudsman which frankly I haven‚Äôt got the time or ‚Äòenergy‚Äô to do!!

A month after the switch we get a ludicrous bill of over ¬£500 for a one month period. I live in a medium sized terrace house with one housemate, and currently pay ¬£67 for gas & electric combined. Common sense would indicate to anyone that the bill was incorrect.

I was annoyed at the audacity of the bill but was somewhat calmed by the agent on live chat who was polite. The issue stemmed from them making estimates, once I provided our move in meter readings I was told the problem would be sorted. Fast forward to 3 weeks later, a similar electricity bill arrives for over ¬£500. Still based of estimates. Absolute joke and waste of my time. 

I give them the benefit of the doubt that it's just sheer incompetence. However, I do worry how many people end up paying these completely ridiculous bills without checking.

As mentioned, common sense would have told edf that that amount was incorrect. Glad I switched from them and will never in my life be switching back.

Worst experience with an energy company. I have switched to a different company in June, when they have generated a final invoice based on wrong readings. 
More than 5 months later they have still not been able to solve this issue after countless hours speaking to them on the phone and on chat! Every single time I need to explain the issue from scratch and every single person give me a different possible solution which is never the right one. 
AVOID IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND YOUR DAYS CHATING WITH THEIR USLESS TEAM!!!!

They left me without electricity and gas for a day and I am pregnant and I had to survive till next day when I could call a manager to sort out the issue as I was anxious and stressed.
But after 6 months still going on issues and issues and the worse part is that I can‚Äôt change the company as they don‚Äôt let me go!

Billing is a complete mess. Being chased for almost ¬£3000 for a meter which isn't mine. Have had their engineer out to confirm it isn't mine (which took almost a year!) And they are still sending me bills. I am now threatened with legal action. They have repeatedly tried to take the money from my account. Thankfully my bank have been very good at blocking it and helping me. No one to escalate it to. Just complaint ""experts"" who can't do anything. No managers to pick it up or help.

Considering switching to EDF? Don't bother and save yourself money, time and hassle!
As an existing EDF customer I recently switched to a cheaper tariff. Despite providing my bank details twice EDF maintained they didn't have it and couldn't set up the DD.
When they eventually set it up the payment dates and amounts were different to what had been agreed over the phone. When I complained they claimed they had no record of the telephone conversation! How very convenient!
Unfortunately EDF have a track record in mismanaging DD payments for my account which they just brush aside without accepting any responsibility or consequences for their shockingly poor customer service!
Don't take my word for it. The highly respected Consumer group Which? in a recent survey ranked EDF joint 27th out of 35 energy companies rated by 7,355 members of the public! Which? went on to state EDF achieved a poor two-star rating in the value for money category.
I would NOT recommend using EDF under any circumstances. They treated me in very shabby way! I would urge you to take your complaints, if not settled to your satisfaction, to the Ombudsman. That is the only way to force improvements to their customer service.

THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER USED..... Four years ago I had just moved into my new house and setup a 'dual fuel tariff' for gas and electric. The gas part was correct but EDF billed me for the wrong electric meter. The meter concerned was actually across the road for which I had no ownership. When my electric bill arrived for the correct meter it was with Swalec NOT EDF. Initially EDF refused to acknowledge they had made the mistake. At the same I offered to pay the gas part of the bill, but EDF refused saying my gas could only be paid after the situation had been corrected. This dragged on for another 14 months whereby my gas bill was unpaid as EDF still refused they'd made a mistake. All the time I was being billed by Swalec who were not really interested but wanted their electric bills paid. 

Fourteen months on because of EDF I owed ¬£1500 to Swalec. EDF finally admitted their mistake at this point and demanded I pay the full bill of ¬£4500. I complained to the ombudsmen. I was offered ¬£75.00 and a letter of apology from EDF. That was it, way short of the thousands now owed. I tried to take the matter further with a solicitor who painfully told  me I had no rights and could not afford any legal challenges. 

After another year of wrangling with EDF who refused to pay any compensation other than ¬£75 sent the bailiffs in who threatened me on my doorstep with breaking limbs etc for a bill now standing at ¬£6800.00. After an emergency call to the CAB the bailiffs left and I was forced onto a debt management programme which as stated was caused by EDF.

You would think that after all this EDF would never make the same mistake again..... boy was I wrong. After phoning a gas meter reading through in July 2020, I thought my actual gas usage was too high. The call handler then informed me my account had been locked and he would look into it. He contacted me by phone a few days later stating he nor anyone else could find any any reason as to why the account was locked, who locked it and how long it had been locked. Presumably they knew I would contact the ombudsman again because another call a few days after was with a different call handler and guess what, they offered me ¬£75.00 and an apology. The reason being.... my overall debt had increased by ¬£355.00 because they had been billing me incorrectly (AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!) because my account had been locked by EDF.

As of today I'm still waiting for a senior EDF manager to contact me. I have demanded they reduce the debt by ¬£355.00 i.e. the increase they created. So far they have refused. 

Please read this review a few times and let it sink in what EDF are as a company. Ask yourself if you would ever want to be put in the position I'm in twice in four years and owing thousands because of EDF. 

EDF are useless, unprofessional, unhelpful, will not take responsibility for their mistakes and should be avoided at all costs. Trust me, its worth paying more with a different company than having to suffer everything EDF has done to myself and my family. My children have gone without for pretty much everything because of EDF. You have been warned.......

P.S. 0 out of 5 would have been given if allowed, 1 is way too generous.

Hi
Fact is that EDF has given me a faulty gas meter and have done nothing to remedy  the situation for over 2 years. So the Ombudsman's award of ¬£50 is paltry. Also EDF have made several appointments to check the electricity meter which showed I owed them over ¬£600 for an empty property and then cancelled them. They expected me to spend 3 hours waiting in a cold property for an engineer to call but the engineer cannot ring me 30 minutes before hand. The Ombudsman thinks their action is OK.

I am copying and pasting the Energy Ombudsman's decision against 
EDF Energy:

'Conclusion
After reviewing your complaint, whilst I am satisfied that the billing of your account (based on the current evidence to hand) is valid, I do acknowledge that you have experienced a poor level of customer service as the company has failed to respond or provide you with assistance in regards to your gas meter concerns. 

I appreciate your request for a financial award based on the time and trouble the matters have caused you. However, Ombudsman Services do not base awards on the number of hours which a complainant has spent dealing with a complaint.  There are a number of reasons for this. It is not possible for me to determine the number of hours invested in a complaint ‚Äì or which of those hours it was necessary to invest. Nor is it reasonable for me to differentiate between complainants based on how they value their time. Accordingly, our office make an approximate assessment of the time and trouble experienced by a complainant caused by the shortfalls of the participating company. Where we see fit, we can propose an award to acknowledge this.  
After reviewing your complaint, I will require the company to apply a ¬£50 credit to your account EDF account as a gesture of goodwill. This is because I consider this goodwill award to be proportionate to acknowledge your experience with the company and the poor customer service provided. I am satisfied that the supporting evidence highlights that the company has not provided you with the appropriate level of care whilst handling your gas meter concerns, which I would have expected. I acknowledge the frustration which EDF‚Äôs failure to respond or provide assistance may have caused you. 

Lastly, I will require the company to provide you with a written apology to acknowledge the inconvenience and shortfalls in customer service, which I identified.
Outcome: Upheld

I then tried to switch suppliers but EDF refused as within the few days of switching, I had  obviously spent 8 quid which was unbilled but they regarded it as 'debt', so they make it impossible to switch.

Contrary to what you read on line they do not follow any of their policies:
Complaints procedures 
Standards of service 
Vulnerability register.
CEO Greg does not monitor or pick up on any CEO complaints. 
If you complain you get one email stating what they want to do and that is it. 
You cannot reply or ask questions. 
From then on you only get a response if you write something negative on social media. 
That will trigger a reply saying, ‚ÄòWe are sorry and will look into this,‚Äô however nothing happens. 
They put in SMET2s with speed to hit targets however when these fail after 10 weeks they are unable to send an engineer and refuse to fix themselves remotely although they could do this. 

They leave you with a faulty meter which they installed and you have to approach alternative energy companies to see if they will take you on with a faulty meter and fix the sub standard equipment that octopus installed.

They are ignore emails and phone calls and never give an email address that you can reply directly to. The complaints team will never speak to you on the phone.

This company must be the worst one I have ever dealt with. I had minor nighles with them over inaccurate billing for three years and after that the bills were all over the place. At one point I was billed for 2000kWhrs in less than a month, a figure which is ludicrous. It has taken months of fighting and no less than eight revised bills before my balance was reduced to zero. I still have been unable to obtain a final bill. I left in disgust and went back to one of the big six.

My SMART meter lost connecting (again) 11 July. Two engineers have visited my home the first to remove the meter ( which was working just not connected to Octopus) but then failed to see we also export energy and so connection was not restored. The second engineer was not authorised to work on our phase 2 meter. So still no connection, but more significantly I have not been paid for our export energy since 31/5/22 which I estimate to be ¬£800. Octopus say they can't pay until the connection was been restored which is not true because they do have the data until 11 July. Avoid this company as customer service is appalling. After 8 weeks I will be going to the ombudsman again.

I had a solar installation in April 2022 and I've been an Octopus customer more or less since then. From day one they told me there was a software issue between my British Gas smart meters and their system, which would be getting sorted very soon. In the mean time it meant that I HAD to stay on the SEG tariff until it was sorted. This meant that they would only pay me 4.1p per kwh for electricity I export, but they offered to make it up to 7.1p while I waited. I also had to give monthly meter readings. However, with each months bills the additional 3p per kwh hour was more often than not not paid. Which meant every time I had to email a member of the customer service team to remind them to pay it, and on occasion had to get into an argument about whether I was entitled to it or not. Anyway, after a year of this (with regular emails asking when it would be sorted) I'd had enough and informed them that if they didn't sort it out I'd make a complaint to the ombudsman. Approximately two weeks later they had installed new meters. This November was my first billing on a new tariff with the new meters, and surprise surprise they didn't pay me anything for my exported electricity! I feel that Octopus have been stealing from me, and continually fobbing me off with excuses while they take my excess export electricity at a ridiculously low rate or for nothing! I'm sick to the back teeth with Octopus Energy, their system also seems to be deliberately complicated, so that it makes it almost impossible to understand what the hell is going on! My recommendation would be, avoid them at all costs!

Octopus Energy's Deplorable Customer Service

I am deeply frustrated with Octopus Energy's customer service and their inability to resolve our gas supply issues. Since April, we've faced repeated gas supply disruptions, leaving us without gas three times. Despite numerous phone calls, Octopus Energy has proven unhelpful and unwilling to address the problem.

The main issue revolves around the misclassification of our gas meter as a ""smart meter"" in their system, which it isn't, as confirmed by an engineer. This misinformation forces us to explain our situation repeatedly, wasting our time and patience.

Moreover, we've been left without gas on two separate weekends, and the card we use for top-ups, not even provided by Octopus Energy, is now malfunctioning. They've been unable to provide a solution.

As of now, we're out of gas for the third time, and we're running out of emergency credit. Octopus Energy's lack of responsiveness leaves us uncertain about when and if they'll provide a permanent solution.

In summary, Octopus Energy's customer service is a complete disappointment, marked by their incompetence and unwillingness to address our ongoing gas supply problems. We strongly discourage others from choosing them as their energy provider.

I have sent octopus many many communications asking them to look at the error in their calculation of our consumption and all I got is lame customer service letters asking me for more and more meter readings and the latest customer service letter says ""we have underestimated your consumption of electricity and we will adjust the consumption and ask you to make your final payment.""

Horrendous Company - Billing a disaster
Last year I made the horrendous mistake of coming back to Octopus energy after a previous bad experience, bigger fool me.

In the space of the last 4 hours my latest bill has gone from -¬£371, to -¬£3,860, to -¬£1,5683 and when I called to query, by the time I have finished the call it had gone to -¬£1,630. I have always provided regular meter reading and my contract with them is about to end and suddenly they hit me with a massive bill and completely fail to explain the reason for the massive bill fluctuations.

My advise is stay well away from this company, the bad service and experience always comes at the end of the contract, profiteering from departing customers.

I originally posted this review on Trustpilot and they removed it for spurious reason, but mainly because they are working with these companies to suppress negative feedback.

Tried to change to this company, after 7 days and trying to drag information out of Gavin ( terrible customer advisor ) final got a quote of over ¬£500 a year more than I am currently paying? What a Joke! this quote was even based on my current bill dated this month of which they had a copy of. Advertising all over the internet for incentive's to join them but they will not confirm this. So I decided to do what this company boast about, i.e. if you have a problem contact Greg personally and he will deal with any problems, another Joke. Obviously this man has enough money now from the customers he has and he is no longer interested in new business, or maybe it is because I am a low usage customer or I am currently tied to existing supplier for the next 2 months?? I will never know, but like all companies who get complacent the fall comes sooner or later leaving customers distraught while the big cats simply walk away. They certain have the right name, 7 hands don't know what the hands doing

Octopus energy is the worst customer service I had. When Octopus took over Bulb company, octopus started taking direct debits of 185.00 monthly then after a few months I noticed they had been taking additional payments of 44.67 in June 2023,44.67 on May 2023, and 75.84 in April 2023. When I enquired the staff named Rumbie M found out that I owe ¬£350 to BULB company and they are taking that extra payment for that. The month they have been describing as ¬£ 350 credit given to my account on March 2023. I checked my statement and found that I have been paying ¬£185.00 direct debit to bulb and in the month of March I had made an excess payment of ¬£573.58 excess into my bulb account for the usage of electricity and gas. When I sent the proof of the payment an Employee named George introduced as manager sent a reply that he would look into that and sort it out and emailed me that they would give a ¬£75 credit to my account due to the bad customer service. I was expecting a fair check into my account and reimbursed the excess money deducted from my account.

But till now I have not got that ¬£75 credit. Till now they have not returned the extra money deducted from my account.
I am not sure why these gas companies are ripping my money every month. In the news, it is shown that they are making a lot of profit
In the summertime, I did not use any gas and my usage was very less. Then they had to reduce the direct debit from ¬£185. But no change in my direct debit.
Recently I got an email that I had two accounts in my name with Bulb Energy company and that is why the outstanding balance is coming. The meaning is that I have one house to use gas and electricity but have been charging as two accounts in my name and charging double the money. The staff do not have shame to sent like this email and not sorting the account issues.



This is the worst energy company at present. The staff are inefficient and incapable of customer service There are no proper managers in this company to solve customer issues.
The Octopus Energy company is making a lot of profits by taking excess payments and not working with properly trained customer staff.
My rating would be zero and would not recommend this energy company to any of my friends and families.

You are destroying peoples mental health!
Absolute scam!

If I could give zero I would ! I'm in the middle of getting my case together to name and shame them. I moved to my new property in April and changed from shell to octopus !
I've never had a bill and prefer pay as you go key, card or even a smart metter.
I used this on my previous energy supplier Bulb absolutely no issue what so ever.

I'm a single mum of four children one of which has mental health conditions we moved in and was waiting for our oven for quite sone time so was very limited energy usage ! Pretty much they have made up a figure of over ¬£2000 that's literally impossible! From July to July,  both companies blamed each other neither replied to any of my emails .

In the mean time I can only have a smart metter if my door gets put through with a warent and there's still no availability from April to October. Even sent an email to the heas of octopus who apologised said he would make us priorty ! Then after no contact I replied and absolutely nothing again.

From my point of view they trap you into a bill and try and keep you off smart ,key ,card so they can mess around with the figures and do what the hell they like, as one of your own employees said if I had used that much it would have blown my flat up in that short of time .

I have all the evidence and will show everyone how you actually make you're dirty money of people with absolutely nothing and wreck their families shame on you !



When transferring to octopus I asked from day one to be put onto this method I was told there are no available appointments! 

Then no only that

I ended my tenancy and closed my account and on May 5th in credit and have a correct final bill. But then received 3 more ""final bills"" for the for the May 6th to June 6th period. The electric bill  for ¬£1600  was way above my historic use of ¬£60. After several complaints this was eventually canceled. However the ¬£360 gas demand is ongoing as of late October. 100 units of gas a month is double my 12 month bill. Which only applies to central heating in winter ( no water heating. cooking, or fires) and this for a period of high temperature weather.

The bill is based on an estimate and thanks to the agent I have the readings on 6th June. These show no gas use during the month before this. Octopus are not imputing these readings  and doing the ""we have not heard from you for while"" and pass to debt agency tactics. What a load of scumbags with a years profit of 4.2 million. It is making me ill and creating a nightmare existence damn them to hell

Despite Octopus' claim to answer emails 'sometimes within hours' I have not had a reply to my email of 12 days ago, I know others have had the same problem. This is terrible service, they don't seem to care once they have you in their clutches. If they did they would have 'chat' as my previous companies did. I rang a few days ago, the girls said the phone lines said they were so busy as people were ringing instead of emailing! What else are we suppose to do if they don't answer our emails? She said she would email me straight away, am still waiting. Am leaving if things don't improve, I find it unnerving not to be able to get an answer to my queries. My latest query is how to distinguish between the export and import submit readings boxes. Still, they do say they do things differently, not sure ignoring customers is something to boast about! And how do they get such high ratings on some sites and low on others? Love and Power

Emailed Octopus in reply to an email advising my direct debit was increasing. 

I explained that I regularly have to request refunds as large amounts build up in my account and it definitely did not need increasing again. 

I spoke to Nafeesa who assured me that she would look into this which she duly did and confirmed that me direct debits would not increase. 

Several days later I received a follow up email confirming the decision and checking that I was happy with this.

I've been a customer of Octopus for more than 3 years, but my recent experience has been nothing short of frustrating. For over two months, I've been trying to get a refund, and it's been an uphill battle.
Every week, when I contact their customer service, I'm met with excuses about system issues and delays. It's disheartening to see a company so consistently fail to deliver on their promises. I've provided all the necessary details, but the problem remains unresolved.
I believe in giving companies a chance to make things right, but my patience has worn thin. 
This level of customer service is simply unacceptable. I hope sharing my experience here will prompt Octopus to take action and improve their service quality,otherwise deffinetly they will lose costumers as I am still waiting for my refund.

The CEO of this company describes the customer care offered by Octopus Energy as ""outrageously good"".Since the end of November 22 I have written 17 letters to Octopus Energy - including three that were marked expressly for Mr.Jckson's personal attention.He hasn't bothered to reply to any of the letters addressed to him.I have received ONE reply to the rest of my letters.This is both very discourteous and extremely unprofessional.
When you phone Octopu Energy,the staff are very polite but hopelessly incompetent and less than truthful.They agree to actions that simply don't happen.I have been challenging the ""estimated"" bills that I have been sent for the last three years - they are always huge overestimates of the real amount of fuel that I've used.The bills are unintelligible and obviously designed to bamboozle the customer.
Octopus Energy recently stopped sending me paper statements of my account- without my permission,and without telling me.I phoned up to enquire why I hadn't received a bill for a long time - I was informed that someone had stopped the paper bills and set up a ""dummy"" electronic account that wasn't accessible to the customer!!!! I demanded to know who had authorised this and the date when my paper statements had been stopped.
I was told:""this information is unavailable"".
The fulsome Which! reviews of Octopus Energy have about as much validity as the Octopus Energy trustpilot propaganda.The Which! survey results are based on 0.02% of energy company customers in the U.K..They have no statistical validity.The Octopus Energy trustpilot site contains thousands of gushing accounts of the alleged excellence of the company and individual members of Octopus staff.Do they write this stuff themselves?There are no spelling mistakes,no incorrect grammar,no ""industrial language"" - quite unlike genuine trustpilot sites.

Dodgy, unorganised, untrained staff, useless company.
Worst company that has ever existed. They overcharged me by ¬£2000 and wouldn't refund it. Had to take to ombudsman as they were not even getting back to me. They didn't help even when correct meter readings were provided again and again and charged me for 5 people household instead of single person based on old meter readings from a different energy company. It's a whole thing, I don't usually rant about a company and have never made a complaint before. So I've had a very very bad experience. If they had just rang me back or tried to help (and refund me what was owed) I wouldn't be complaining. The staff were rude, unhelpful and they are a very dodgy company who basically have robbed me.

They are the absolute worst at responding to emails. To wait 4 or 5 WEEKS for a response is very normal.

However, if you can get them on the phone, pretty good!!

We were happily with edf for years and i loved my smart meters until, summer 22, they stopped working.


Edf refused to change them, claiming a signalling issue.


So, i switched to octopus april this year. Email communication was slow but i did get 2 new smart meters fitted 31st may.


The electric one swung into action right away. The gas failed to do so.


Finally today (august 11th)  a simple phone call ,in which a lady told me to press some buttons on the gas meter, has rectified the issue and i have 2 working smart meters!!


Oh happy days!!



What i do like about octopus is that even without smart meters, you can send them a manual read any time via the app and it takes the payment right away so you never get behind.


Email communication is abysmal though.

AVOID THEM!!! Careful with them, they OVERCHARGE you, then bully you with Debt collector!
On one of my account, where we never lived or used the flat, I made a final payment in May. They proved my balance is ZERO and said my account is CLOSED down, then shortly after they started to send a bill with around ¬£40.00 to me and bully me with debt collector. As I said , the flat has never been used by us, and the octopus account should exist for a month only then closed down in May. Now it is August and I still try to close it down but strangely some extra payments occured on that account!
On my other account where we live and I pay by Direct Debit after paying my monthly bill they simply charged me backward for April-May-June in June nearly ¬£120.00 ! As I said AFTER paying my PAY-AS-I-USED bill!!!! That means, I payed directly and correctly how much they wanted every month by direct debit!

I've just had my second terrible experience with their customer service this year. I was wondered if the man I was dealing with is new, so repeatedly I gave him some slack, but I've just phoned up and got incredibly frustrated with the terrible service from someone else so sadly it isn't just him.

They have taken a direct debit payment from my account when they assured me the payment wouldn't be taken as they had set it up on the incorrect date. At the time I emailed them to state clearly if it came out on that date then I would be making two payments this month which I couldn't afford, 

I was told that the email was a mistake and that payment wouldn't be taken. When they took it out anyway, I emailed them to explain I was told that payment wouldn't come out, and they emailed to say there was a technical issue, (once again it was like they hadn't even read my short email properly), and not to worry the payment hadn't been taken. I knew it had but got confirmation from my bank anyway. 

When I called up they said they couldn't refund the payment because my account was in debt, with no acknowledgement that the mistake was theirs. Initially they said they couldn't refund it, then when I stood my ground they said they could try to refund it but that it might not go through. 

I explained the debt on my account (under ¬£200) was due to my housing association taking 4 months to fix my broken boiler, so I was forced to use the emergency tank for all the time, doubling my bills. I have already explained that to them twice before, and I that I will do my best to get a grant from the council to pay that back. 

I told them that because this double payment has come out I can't afford my other current bills, (I am disabled, a carer and on their priorities list, none of which seemed to matter). 

I asked several times if I could speak to a supervisor or manager, they refused. I explained this is very stressful and time consuming, they still refused. They told me I needed to go back to my bank and make an indemnity claim, even though it was their fault that they took an unauthorised payment from a vulnerable customer struggling, like many others, with the criminal energy prices and the cost of living scam. No apology or any responsibility taken for that incorrect payment.

They eventually said they will put the refund through, but that there is no guarantee that it will be sucessful and will take up to ten days. So I went through the bank for the indemnity claim and they told me that it is common for companies to act in this way.

The last issue I had was trying to apply for their OctoAssist fund, where there was 9 emails backwards and forwards about the broken PayWall link on their website. Again, I was repeatedly told unhelpful and irrelevant information in the emails, like someone who doing a quick copy and paste without reading properly what I had written, and again it was time consuming and stressful. Thankfully when I called up there was someone helpful who sorted it all out for me that time. 

The most recent incident however has been disgusting treatment of their priority list customers. I would leave if I thought any other company would be any better.

I pay Octopus ¬£242 per month by  direct debit and only use ¬£88 combined energy a month.  They took the remaining ¬£154 and INCREASED my debit by ¬£154.  I one erroneous accounting move they have put me ¬£308 more in debit and effective stole my ¬£154.  This company basically robs people.  Out 3.5 million customers there must be at least a 1000 in my position with false debits applied to their accounts‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs ¬£5M that they are stealing from customers. The stress of dealing with a company that repeatedly says the bills are correct whilst correspondingly trying to coerce into payment plans that will tie you to the debit that‚Äôs not your.  Octopus needs their accounting practice audited fast.

Time and time again we were overcharged by octopus energy we were getting charged for 2 meters when we only had 1, even though Octopus energy knew this nothing was done about it and until I switched suppliers the overcharged bills were still coming in .

I was switched to Octopus when my utility company went bust. They seemed ok until I noticed a few things on my bills.
I always provide meter readings when prompted, every month and submit them within the 3 day deadline given. On 2 separate months I could see that I had been charged for half a meter read bill and the other half as an estimated bill. In all my years I have never seen this so I queried it and was first told that I need to submit meter readings which is why it was an estimate, which I went back to say I had (I had the reply emails thanking me for submitting them).
Then they said it was because in the middle of the month price increases had occurred and as I hadn't provided meter readings for them, they had estimated that half of the bill.
I replied how would I know to submit meter readings twice in one month if they didn't ask for them but as they had asked for the one reading, I had submitted it.
They came back to apologise and offered me ¬£30 after I had asked them to escalate my complaint.
I declined and asked them again to escalate my complaint and they came back again offering me ¬£40 which I again declined asking them for the 3rd time to escalate the complaint.
Then they came back very passive aggressive to say that the ¬£40 offered was way too much and it was dropped back to ¬£30. I replied that as I hadn't asked for money as compensation I would be again declining and had to ask yet again for the issue to be escalated.
I am currently awaiting the outcome of their investigation at the way it's been handled.
Its all very odd.

I certainly do not recommend Octopus energy. Customer service and Issue Resolution Department are beyond abysmal. Staff are not trained, they do not respond to emails, and fail to keep promised phonecalls.  
Five weeks later and still my issue has not been dealt with.  Since Octopus Smart meter was fitted in December 2022 my gas usage has inexplicably soared despite me reducing usage.  First Octopus adviser stated it was the difference in f3 and m3 measurements between  Smart and old meter.  Second adviser did not know what f3 measurements were and had to look it up on Google.  Issue resolution adviser did not make promised phone call to explain / clarify.  I despair.    Lee T. Moore

Absolutely shocking customer service. I moved to Octopus energy and realised that my first meter readings had been put in by Octopus the wrong way round. I emailed explaining this with photos of my meter and my final bills from my previous energy supplier where they are the correct way round. I received no reply. I email again a few days later, no reply. I then call and was asked to perform a test and send in photos of the meter at certain times. I did this, 3 weeks later‚Ä¶still no reply. I‚Äôve also noticed that further incorrect meter readings have been put onto my account by Octopus! I gave them my latest meter readings with photos to show they are the wrong way round, and they‚Äôve simply put them on the wrong way round again.

I‚Äôve been emailing and calling for over a month. I did a social media nudge. I‚Äôve emailed greg@octopus.energy. I‚Äôve sent in a formal complaint. No response.

Completely at my wits end, I then leave a negative review on Feefo. The final nail in the coffin - the reply I receive on there from Team Leader Zain is calling me Ernie?! Clearly a copied and pasted response, no curtesy to even change the name and no care at all.

I receive an email from Zain asking me to email a copy of my final bill from my previous energy company. I replied promptly with a screenshot of this...but this is extremely frustrating because I'd already sent this 4 weeks ago! Of course, I haven't received a reply from this email, and my account is still incorrect.

I'm now extremely worried I'm going to receive a large electricity bill, as I haven't received a bill for electricity since I joined 4 months ago.

avoid at all cost! not only the worst energy company I dealt with but one of the worse experiences I ever had with providers! Sending crazy bills (double/triple amount of what it ends up after recalculation), they hide the meter readings data (blaming smart meter), not informing you they can't read your meters, they make up readings,  it is impossible to get any transparency on the data, no response to any emails, or 'copy-paste' template responses, completely ignorant. They charge me nearly ¬£500 for 3 month (gas + electric) in summer months for 1 person in 1 bed flat! Case with Ombudsman.

As having surplus  money in my account I requested to have some of it returned... Told ten day turnaround for refund which to me seems very excessive and costing me interest in savings account as going back to the old way of holding my energy money in savings account to gain interest rather lying in octopus account making nothing for me but they are getting free money...

Customer service extremely poor. I have been trying to get octopus to connect me for an export tarrif for my solar pannels for over 4 months & still no joy. Nobody follows up on anything, it is always me chasing them to get things moving. During this time, I have not been getting paid for my solar production, but they are quite happy to charge me in full for the energy I import. I am paying over the odds, in a cost of living crisis thanks to their poor service. I would highly recommend avoiding octopus energy.

Since switching to Octopus Energy I've had more than a dozen problems with them, in less than a year. They took weeks & weeks to resolve. 3 took more than 4 months.
& I've just came across 2 more problems (hence I'm writing this) but I'm not going to go into them.

Just remember these things:

‚ö´ Don't bother emailing them, often it takes 2 or 3 weeks for them to reply & usually the reply doesn't resolve the issue. DIRECTLY CALL THEM.

‚ö´ Don't set up Direct Debt with them. Wait & check your billing statement & make sure everything is as it should be.

I've been trying to resolve my issues with my metre readings for over 6 months now.
I moved into a property in January 2023 and have been in touch with Octopus energy regular for help uploading my metre readings. Everytime i contact them, i speak to somebody different and they ask me for different things. After doing everything they have asked of me for over 6 months to resolve this issue, i have now been told that i have been billed incorrectly due to the metre readings submitted. This was very soon (approx 1 hour) after i received an email from somebody saying that my bills were accurate and normal.
I am now being told i need to back-pay those incorrect payments that were made, even though i have done absolutely everything that was asked of me. With the increasing financial crisis, it really worry's me that i am in this situation, and i'm also 6 months pregnant so i'm sure you can appreciate the stress and worry that this situation has me under. The help i have received from Octopus energy has been very poor, i have tried to make 2 complaints and they have not been acknowledged/ taken seriously.
I dont think i should have to pay these incorrect payments from past months and i want all the credit in my account to be sent back to me immediately, along with the correct payment breakdown confirmed for our energy moving forward.

I am extremely unhappy! 

I have been with octopus for 2 years and I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted. Back in December I was without gas for around 2 months, once they finally agreed to send someone out between 9-5, the first day he did not turn up and second day he turned up at 2am asking me if I was home alone and was very weird with me. I complained about this and asked to take my complaint further, they did not care and did not help me take my complaint further.. 

Had another man come out and tell me octopus didn‚Äôt even call the correct job in- 3 engineers later and it still was not fixed. I told the woman that I did not want the creepy 2am engineer near my house as I shouldn‚Äôt feel unsafe in my home. They told me they won‚Äôt get him to do the job, days later he turned up at my house after being given this job! 

To make things worse, I ended up having a charge once everything was fixed, this was due to them incorrectly sorting the direct debit up and putting me on a payment holiday. 

The charge was ¬£280! I told them around 2 months ago that I was moving house and not taking them with me as I‚Äôm in pleased and that I want to pay the ¬£280 in installments as my car had broken down and the cost of moving is expensive. They agreed to split it into 6 monthly payments‚Ä¶ they sent me confirmation of this.  first payment just came out for the full ¬£280! 

This company is honestly a joke and I am very very unhappy with my service!

BEWARE OF THESE CROOKS YOU WERE WARNED!! MINUS 5 STARS
These crooks will take advantage however long you allow them to.
firstly, non existent customer service can't possibly be rated.
The problem is, they claim to have the best one! i am still trying to figure out where and how you can get hold of it.
They will only be in touch with you if there is a way to make money of you.
They treat/ed me like such an idiot, as if i am downright ignorant. the issue is, that as a come-over from bulb, with whom i had an ongoing case (which is what octopus took over), i am by know well versed in my rights, and the procedures and laws.
I told them this, and wrote that I will not take any underhanded threats sitting down, after they tried a horde of threats in order to try and get me to budge from my position. But the ignoramuses that  THEY are, they thought that they could still try this with me.
What did they do?
After me waiting a long time for a reply for my issue, they sent me an entirely irrelevant email saying that ""We‚Äôd like to get this sorted; we‚Äôve been trying to get in touch but haven‚Äôt heard back from you yet.
If we can‚Äôt speak with you, our next step is to involve a debt collection agency - which we‚Äôd prefer to avoid.""
What utter lies!! they are not ashamed!!
They've been trying to get in touch with me?!?!
They haven't heard from me?!?!?!
They can't speak with me?!?!
How they have the audacity to dare to write such downright disgusting lies is way above me- but guess what! this is not the first time either!!
I told them the first time they wrote to me with these words that this is untrue and the exact opposite, and want them to fix their mistake, but no! they make the same mistake again, with more threats piled on top of it all!!
But in their blind inability to to step down and say sorry, we made a mistake, lets fix it, they push on, on the way tripping over themselves, just look at the other reviews here, i can see i am not alone unfortunately....
They have the customer service to ask for money and threaten, but they have no customer service to sort out issues. By them sorting out/helping with issues means ""give us money"".
You have been warned...

Giving one star is generous.   The people they employ appear to be told never admit they are wrong.  This can lead to the most absurd situations.  One fellow wrote an email to me telling me that there was no email address connected with my account.  At the same time others were writing to me with no such difficulties.  I explained this in as simple language as I was able.   He still insisted that he or they were right.  Eventually he stopped writing to me leaving my complaints not only unresolved but unaddressed.
On another occasion I was told what I consider to be a lie.  It was connected with the bill and it was an x times y = z  situation.   It was at once obvious that x times y did not equal z on their bill.  After about a month I received an insolent reply.  
They claimed that it was y and not z that was wrong.  Now y was a figure they had invented; a figure they were incapable of writing down.  Quite why they should make up a figure they were incapable of writing down was never explained.  Of course the answer was accompanied by the usual clear implication that if I were not so stupid I would have known it anyway.  So the problem is that I expect their bills to be correct: they in contrast accept no obligation for their bills being correct and boast that their friends in the Ombudsman's Office will support them.   Beyond belief!  but true.   Not surprisingly, there is no agreement, in fact it is become clear that their perception of reality is very different from mine, and that applies to almost everything.

Firstly,
They are rude arrogant and treat you like an idiot.
Secondly,
It took 2 years of solidly complaining that the new smart meter that was fitted wasn't reporting the gas reading, for 18 months it was because of the bad data signal, funnily the electricity was being reported from the same hub...
Thirdly,
Fixed gas broke electricity meter.
Fourthly,
Make sure your energy dashboard matches your bill. When you question why is the gas or electricity is missing you will be told it is your fault for not submitting the readings on time... It's a smart meter....
Finally,
If you haven't noticed fourthly and within 12 months they notice they will debit that amount from you with no notice, irrespective of your ability to pay.

Luckily I am an automation engineer and this type of system is my bread and butter but unfortunately they still argue that they are right, how they are which's number one supplier is beyond me I feel sorry for people without my insight

Where do I begin?
I have been with octopus energy for around 2 years. I was consistently in credit well over ¬£500 so I decided, due to feeling the pinch to ask them for some of it back. After a seemingly long delay, and me requesting 3 times,  they emailed me that there had been some issue their end and I hadn‚Äôt been billed correctly (even though they installed smart meters nearly a year ago) and I now owe them ¬£1351??? So my question is this? If I hadn‚Äôt asked for some of my money back then this ‚Äúerror‚Äù in billing would had continued ‚Äúad infinitum‚Äù and god knows what they would claim I owed them. The other question for me is that if you go along to have a smart meter installed then how the hell can they not get it right? I have been put into massive debt through no fault of my own and have no clue how I‚Äôm going to pay it and keep the services on in my house. Absolute shambles. They offered me a measly ¬£30 for any inconvenience caused which is hardly going to go anywhere near putting this matter right.

Quite shocking, but I am inured to unacceptable customer service in this country now.

Octopus staff double Direct Debit ‚Äúon a whim‚Äù without informing Customer.   Despite previous long standing agreement in place with staff member.
It seems Octopus have gone downhill since Bulb acquisition indicating insufficient Customer Service staff on board.  Octopus used to be ‚ÄúLa Cr√®me de la Cr√®me‚Äù of all energy companies.   They offer a CEO service by email  which doesn‚Äôt exist.  Customer service has now become USELESS.   No reply to emails.   Time wasting company with young hip staff - or so they like to think.   Very UNIMPRESSED.
COMPLAINT LOGGED which has gone to OFGEM / OMBUDSMAN/ MARTIN LEWIS to be notified. 
Advice is:  AVOID OCTOPUS AT ALL COSTS
Octopus like to present as a hippy company - no credibility.  Zero professionalism. Greg Wise CEO - is unimpressive.   Will update this as & when OFGEM / OMBUDSMAN action proceeds. 
Meantime ZERO STARS.   LONG STANDING EXECUTIVE SEARCH / HEADHUNTER COMPANY SPECIALISING IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT GLOBALLY.

Customer service is terrible. Emailed them Five! times in three weeks to join them as a potential new customer. They did not provide enough information for me to simply hand over my card details, I was also extremely suspicious of their incredibly low quote. I decided to ring them as ""The wait times are very quick""
After dialling their number it was disconnected immediately before connecting.
I tried calling their number 0800 164 1088 three times and each time it disconnected. I have to say I was taken in by their friendly approach. However,I
decided to read their reviews first.  I think I have had a narrow escape. I shall stay with my cheating, lying current supplier EDF for the time being. You cannot differentiate between any one of them.

I think their customer service is truly awful. Wait up to 3weeks for reply, obviously don't read the question. Had Smart Meter installed January 19th. Still waiting for them to get it to work. Display on accounts page is wrong. Nobody cares about contacting customer. Complaints are just shovelled back onto the same people who are causing the issue in first place. Awful.

I switched to Octopus on 10th February and as I had not received a bill a month later, sent them the meter readings by email. A few days later I received an email asking for the meter readings! Not impressed.

A bill arrived on 22nd March but there was an error which I pointed out in an email the same day. I received a part-answer today, a month later. Very poor customer service.

The friendly-looking website almost glows with self-satisfaction and you can read, ""Get help from our award-winning Customer Service team. Email us for prompt, friendly support. Try our award-winning email support. Tests by Which? found we typically replied to emails quicker than any other large supplier. Our team answers emails 7 days a week, so we can solve any issue while you get on with your day""

I see that Which? has recently awarded Octopus yet another 'Which? Recommended Provider status'. This is ""Based on a survey of 1,182 Octopus customers carried out in October 2022, and a Which? energy company request for information made in November 2022."" Which? said that Octopus supply three million homes which means the survey covered less than a meagre 0.04% of their customers. From the complaints I have read, it is now obvious that such a low number of replies in the survey is insufficient.

I looked at TrustPilot and see that more than 6,800 - about 5% - of all the 134,425 customers who had given only 1, 2 or 3 stars (out of a possible 5) have serious, current communication problems with Octopus. That belies the Which? findings, doesn't it?

Greg Jackson, the CEO and founder, says on LinkedIn, he is a ""Passionate, creative, innovative CEO, entrepreneur and investor. Love building organisations around people, disrupting industries which underserve customers and society."" I think he should review and rewrite that statement.

I wonder if Octopus have serious problems due to their amazing quick customer growth and product expansion. To me, it looks as if the staff are not getting the support they require to do their jobs and internal systems and computers are letting them down.

If you are thinking of changing energy supplier, think first and review as much as possible. Here's what it's like with Octopus, you may be better off with your existing supplier like BP
Yesterday I had an EV charger installed by Octopus. After very poor communication from the company that arranged the installation work started around 4pm
@greg@octopus.energy Shared as promised------------->
11:15 I called to see if today was still on as no call received yet. I was told it was booked for this afternoon. Why didn‚Äôt they or you tell me it was afternoon in the emails, this would have saved me half a wasted day.
15:00 I called them again asking if there was any update as I had not received a call and was advised the installation takes on average 4 hours! They said they would call the engineer.
15:30 I called again as they hadn‚Äôt called me back. Apparently, the engineer is about 30 minutes away.
16:08 Engineers arrived.
The engineers did an excellent job and were finished by 18:00.
Now we come to the problem. One of the engineers said ‚ÄúI think they have given you an older model‚Äù, even stating ‚Äúit may even be 2nd hand‚Äù.
We both noticed that the cable hanging shelf/hook was not there, just a holder for the plug. So I have nothing to hand the cable on.
We then unwrapped the cable to test it, however I noticed the cable was only 5 metres (the engineer also measured it for me) and therefore would not reach the charging point of the car. I have paid for the 8 metre version.
We then dragged the cable over the roof of the car just to test the installation, however the fitting on the end of the plug did not fit the car. ‚Äúthey‚Äôve sent you the wrong one‚Äù
So, having paid ¬£1099 and waited all day I have a charger that is useless.
I will give you 3 hours to respond with an acceptable solution. You have until Sunday evening 23rd April to fully resolve this. If not please refund the full amount and arrange to remove the charger, allowing me to find an alternative supplier. I have made my credit card company aware of a pending dispute.
I will share this story on social media and the press in 3 hours, 12PM 18/4/2023.
A few other things
I emailed on the 13th to ask why my Gas readings are still unavailable on the app. I can see them on the loop energy app! No response from Octopus!
I have cancelled my direct debit while this goes on.
I will leave you to consider how you may wish to apologise / compensate me for me for my wasted time, while the charger is either replaced or removed and time on emails and calls.

I called over a week ago... was on hold for 30 minutes and gave up.

I sent a message on the form provided on the octopus fb page - a week has passed and no response.

I left in an negative trust pilot review and someone replied saying that someone had already been in touch with me which was a blatant lie.

I then emailed octopus and predictably no response to them for 3 days and counting ....

So..... over a week has passed and still no contact from Octopus energy using any method available.

Having been with Octopus for 2.5 years at my previous property, upon leaving I was presented with a balance of ¬£420 to pay once I had submitted my last meter reading. I rang Octopus 3 times in the last 3 weeks and was assured every time that these payments were to be staggered over a couple of months and that this had been applied to my account.
However, I was still receiving an email stating that I would be debited the full amount in a one off payment in April. I have just spoken to Octopus for the 4th time and have been told that the payment has gone through an the full payment of ¬£420 will be taken this month. I was apologised to with the customer service advisor stating that this had not been dealt in-line with the company's high standards and I was credited with ¬£30 in my account as an apology.

This is absolutely farcical. After speaking to 3 separate employees and being guaranteed that the payments were to be staggered, it is nothing short of a disgrace to be left in this situation. I am in a fortunate position that i can afford to pay a one-off payment of this size but literally thousands of Octopus customers will not be able to pay that amount. It is clear that Octopus energy are happy to disregard the wellbeing and fragility of their customers financial situation and take what they want whenever they want.

OCTOPUS WILL NOT STAGGER YOUR OUTSTANDING BILL WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM. THIS IS NOT PART OF THEIR SERVICE.

Only answer emails after you've nudged them a few times on social media, when you do eventually get a response they are often very condescending if you're lucky enough for them to actually read and understand your concerns or issue.

They are also paying another more well known review site so that they can easily remove negative reviews, they even had a more balanced review of mine removed pretty much straight away, whilst still ignoring an email (regarding them withholding my access to a significant amount of credit) that I'd sent 48hrs prior to that review. 

It is quite apparent that they are more interested in manipulating and protecting their falsely crafted 'great for customers image' than actually delivering anything resembling decent customer service.

Octopus energy got my tariffs the wrong way, first charging me ¬£520. This was after phoning them previously to swap them round. 

I rung again and was put through to a very helpful lady called Tate. She sent a test through to check which meter is which & promised this will be fixed. She also sent me an email after to follow up. A very friendly voice and explained everything throughly. 

When calling to see of octopus had received the new readings I was put through to Molly who helped fix my bill with the correct tariffs and change it their end. She was exceptional and quick! 

As I‚Äôm on economy 7 with storage heaters my bill is around ¬£300 a month, so it‚Äôs expensive even if I switched to a different company.

After a brilliant start my service from this company has gone downhill after that.
Their telephone operatives are usually good although waiting times seem to have increased recently - however, I have been cut off by them twice so far which is very poor !
Regrettably,  the service is bad after that - they seem to be unable to sort my opening  meter readings out for me ( over 8 weeks now) and several promises of getting a call back from a manager have, at the time of writing this , never been honoured. Planning to escalate my complaints to OFGEM tomorrow.

I had the misfortune to have this company as my energy supplier for a few weeks before noticing they are indecently using my direct debit plan and extracting money from my account over and over again without any justification or explanation. Even when I gave them a call and complained and the references for the questionable direct debit payments they asked for copies of my bank statements so they can follow up!! They never investigated anything and just kept wasting time. So I decided to change supplier. I am much happier now. I got those questionable payments back eventually by making a complaint through my bank‚Äôs fraud team and them investigating the case.

This is one of the worst energy companies I have ever dealt with (in fact, companies in general).

We have had an ongoing issue with Octopus Energy for over a year now - We called them many times, and have sent countless emails and even when they got back to us and told us the issue was resolved and we felt some sort of relief, the next month it became evident that they never solved the issue.

Shocking and disgusting company!!!!!!!!!!
I have been brought over from being with BULB for years, excellent company BULB was,  they have changed the policy even though plenty of emails stating they would not change anything, used my emergency credit which was ¬£10 I did not notice they changed it to ¬£20 due to location of meter and it was cold at the time so just wanted heat and hot water, i then put ¬£45 in the meter to cover the emergency credit and maybe have approx ¬£20 credit left over even after I paid charges,  I ended up with ¬£11.18 left??????? Which lasted not even 6 and half on heat and hot water that evening, had to top up again ¬£20 which didn‚Äôt even last 25 hours again the heat 65/80 temperature and hot water is 60/80 temperature on the boiler and I am back in emergency credit again, 2 days later they have emailed saying they have changed the emergency credit limit but you will be charged 30 percent, so using emergency credit had cost me plus charges for not even having the gas on at all, plus standing charges and now ¬£7.50 to use the emergency credit absolutely disgusting to do to any customer, I do completely understand that both standing charges and usage has been ridiculously above average for anyone but this is disgusting changing the contract without customer knowing, I have tried ring this awful company and many  emails the past 3 weeks to no one replying back at all, also my online bill is reading actual reading instead of estimate when no one has read my meter in 3 years and I don‚Äôt have a smart meter shocking company!!!!!!!!

What a sham this ‚Äòbully boy‚Äô company is!
I pay off what I owe each month for my gas supplied by Octopus (I am with another supplier for my electricity). This was due to the extortionate increases in my monthly direct debit, which went up fourfold within a month. After checking back over the past 48 months the amount they instructed I need to pay would have put me in credit by thousands within 12 months. 
Despite clearing my bill each month, they wrote to me threatening that they would enforce a prepayment meter - what, for owing nothing to them! 
I wrote to my MP as it was at the time British Gas was in the news for forcing entry to properties to install prepayment meters and the government made a loose promise to look into this issue. The MP wrote to the chief executive department at Octopus and I received a scathing letter with very little explanation and no apology. At the end of this response there were words used that can easily be construed as my card is marked. 
Ofgem are a waste of space as it feels like they are controlled by the energy companies. 
In my opinion, this type of attitude is not welcome anytime and especially when a large percentage of people are feeling vulnerable due to the cost of living crisis!
We need a proper controlling body who has the courage to stand up to these energy supply companies and enforce more control on them.

Worst company ever! we are paying the agreed direct debit of ¬£100 but our account keeps going in minus every month. By this rate, even if we are paying what octopus told us to pay, we are going to be -¬£2400 by the end of the year. How can a one bedroom flat, without a TV, or a dishwasher, with centralized heating and the hot water not relying on electricity, be charged so much?! Are they claiming that just our two laptops, and 1-2 washing machine per week, and the occasional cooking that we do when we‚Äôre home (which isn‚Äôt often) is enough to add up to the insane numbers you‚Äôre billing us?!! On what planet does this make sense? 
In 2022 we received a letter from them saying that the estimated yearly cost of our electricity would be ¬£355.6. At the end of the year they charged us -¬£760.  They also tried to charge for a property we hadn‚Äôt lived in for over a year even if we had settled the bills before leaving. This February I paid ¬£160 thinking I‚Äôd pay a bit more in order to lower what I owe them. But on the 6th of February I got charged another ¬£214. I‚Äôve never had a company charge me twice for electricity in a month. I keep writing them but they just send me the bills and tell me that everything is stated there. Honestly, I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I spend 3-5 hours every day trying to solve problems with octopus and other companies like them. I feel like trying to survive without being driven bankrupt (even if I pay every single bill) has become a full time job. I wish I knew where to complain about this

Latest contact by email was on the subject of a company acting as an agent on behalf of octopus energy apparently have a contract to chase up customers who have an outstanding debt balance on their account. It is correct that my account balance is not zero, but what's meant to happen is that if my current direct debit payments are not covering the full cost over the year, they are meant to contact me directly and discuss increasing my monthly payments. I am happy to do that provided they keep to their arrangement that they will read my meters 3 times a year due to me being unable to read them myself because I'm disabled it's difficult for me to get down the stairs outside where the meter is located. Reading these reviews I can't see how they behave any better than British gas or EDF , they estimate usage far to high.

Absolutely shocking service Octopus Energy 
Didn't switch me when I requested it from British gas, weeks ago, denied recieving my email and meter readings.
Left me to chase them on it, didn't return calls, and ignored emails. 
Now they have managed to cancel my rental account where I am still leaving and open my new house account where I am not living with the balance that should be on rental property. I wrote asking them not to close rental account until I move out.
Waited over an hour on Friday to speak to someone, then the whole company shuts at 4pm,....so spoke to no one.

Many problems. 
Was switched to them from Avro (who went bust). Had to submit meter readings. They couldn‚Äôt read the meters and so I asked for new ones. Then suddenly extra amounts appeared on my bills! They can intermittently read them now apparently. Then now miraculously the gas one works‚Ä¶not that I was told. But the bills are now extortionate. 
Won ¬£62 on  the wheel -wasn‚Äôt  honoured as they didn‚Äôt have a record of it on their system! Despite my screen shot.

Emails are answer by different people every time and have conflicting information and the manner is very patronising. 
Recently I input my readings and they‚Äôre now gaslighting me saying I did it wrong and then corrected my mistake ‚Ä¶which I did not, but they are implying I am at fault, when they have no proof. They‚Äôre just making things up. 
Nobody has replied to the complaint I made to the complaint email address.

If I could give them zero I would!! We set up a standing order so they could not just take what they wanted from our banks. So they not only receive money from us but also money from the government to top it up. Every month we receive a letter stating that we owe them money, even though we have never missed a payment! Every month we call them to explain this. Their system apparently does not recognise standing orders and the only way around this is to pay by direct debit so they can take what they like each month! Phone call after phone call we have explained and now they have no record of phone calls made to them. We have received another letter from them stating that if we do not comply they will use force, send bailiffs round to fit pre-payment meters. How the hell are you supposed to get through to these people when they are totally ignoring you?! This is stressing us all out and its making us ill. I would understand if we weren't paying them anything or if we missed payments but they've received what they asked for when setting this up!

I am experiencing an incredible amount of distress for which I know no one is going to pay.

I have received the following bill:
Electricity - ¬£457.37 7th Dec 2022 ‚Äî 31st Dec 2022
Electricity - ¬£472.70 1st Jan 2023 ‚Äî 27th Jan 2023
As of 30th Jan 2023 Your balance is below zero: - ¬£847.99

They wrote me that with them my ""estimated annual cost [would be] ¬£179.93"". How did they manage to calculate an expense of over ¬£900 for less than two months, as no one came here to read the meter?
Amongst other things, I have been absent for 20 days (from 22‚Åø·µà December 2022 to 11·µó ∞ January 2023) and, before leaving, I set both radiators (there are only two in the whole house) to vacation mode. I also would like to stress that I spend a huge part of the day at the University and always turn the light off before leaving. I already asked them, but they did not reply. Rather, after some days they sent me the very same bill. By the way, today Experian wrote me that my credit score dropped of 969 (yes.. nine hundred sixty nine!) points. I suspect the two things are related.

The honeymoon is over with Octopus, simply put people like me ar paying the price for the likes of Bulb customers.

Not happy either with the stupid system of billing you for 3 weeks then a seperate single week.

Trying to tell me that I spent ¬£125 on electricity in 3 weeks then suddenly spent ¬£85 in just one week?

Don't think so.

I have been trying to get re-enrolled on my previous tariff for over 2 months, after the link they emailed me to allow me to 'continue on Octopus Go' myself wouldn't work. I emailed them about that but never got a reply.  Since then I've been on their 'Flexible' tariff and today's price is 63p/kWh - compared to the 12.9p I was on before the other tariff ended on December 3rd. Since then, we have been charged over ¬£1000 for using less electricity than we did the year before over the same 3 month period. All of the credit I built up to see us through the energy price rise (which if the 'switch yourself' link had worked would have been more than double the price per kWh but not 4 times!) has been sucked up and they STILL haven't sorted out our tariff switch - they are holding us to ransom by taking so long, by not having an actual phone number, not being able to speak to or even email the same person to sort this out and by being generally unresponsive, and all the while have essentially picked our pocket. We are stuck. I work from home and am sitting here most days with a coat on, and we don't even use gas to heat the house! we have solar panels and an ASHP - what other efficiency improvements could I possibly make??
Avoid!!

I am echoing the frustration of other customers having just come off the phone to their customer 'services'. Total incompetence and unwillingness to hear what I was telling them. They charged me over ¬£470 for two months when the bills were ¬£25 per month previously - I have solar panels. They claimed energy prices have massively increased to which I responded 'by that much within a month?!!"" - needless to say they had no answer for that. We were ¬£600 in credit this morning, only after we sent in a meter reading, on their request, did we find out we are now ¬£130 in credit. They could not explain why my SMETS2 meter was not supplying them with this information and keeping bills updated. They also claimed that I should have migrated onto another tariff and that they had sent an email which I did not receive, they say that they have records of this email being sent, received and opened multiple times by the same IP address - I have asked them for proof of this and for the original email to be sent again to me - so far I have heard nothing. I asked them to compensate me the difference in my bill had I migrated onto the other tariff to which they said it would be difficult to work out what our usage was - even though they have charged me for the same usage!! Unlikely any Octopus employee will read these complaints so I will be taking this to a more open arena.

The worst company to deal with ever!!! Moved into my property on 14th September and I have been billed for nearly ¬£6500 for a small 3 bed house. Can't register my solar panels and I'm being past from pillar to post. App won't even accept most of my meter readings. Since speaking to a debt collector today the meter readings that were on the app that were accepted have now changed to estimated ones. Best of it is I've been trying to get someone to deal with it from day one and no one can tell me why or how I have these problems, no one knows anything and they are now threatening me with admin fees and debt collectors after two weeks of receiving this absurd bill even though I've spoken to numerous people to try and sort it out!!

I must admit that I find all these 5* reviews of this company rather suspicious, and totally contrary to my experience of them over the past couple of years. I have found them totally incompetent and disinterested to engage, let alone address any issue. They take between a week and over a month to even reply (and not the couple of hours they claim!!), and then all they do is offer meaningless waffle as opposed to resolving anything. In the latest contact with them, which started 3 months ago (they alarmingly stopped featuring the electricity consumption readings in my bills, so I was worried of a massive bill coming at some stage), I have been going round in circles getting nowhere, so I contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau for help. Octopus refused to even engage with the CAB, contrary, apparently, to a contract they have with them! It appeared that the CAB were hardly surprised, so it was not their first experience with this company. Amongst things, Octopus claim that they do not know the model of my smart meter, when the CAB were able to find this after a quick search! Matter is now with the Ombudsman‚Äôs office. They hide behind a fa√ßade of ‚Äòcustomer friendliness‚Äô, ‚Äògreen credentials‚Äô  and political correctness but offer a totally unacceptable level of service! Avoid if possible AND DO NOT TRUST THE REVIEWS!!

They are on another planet. We were moved from bulb to this shambles of a company. At that point we could not choose to go to another company. As we have no relationship with octopus we asked to have your accrued money back, the initially said no, we pushed it and they gave us most of it back, and we changed to pay for what we use rather than just an ever changing monthly amount. This is when our prices shot up another ¬£100 a month‚Ä¶ when we questioned this the useless ‚Äòhuman‚Äô online just repeated the same answers, we may as well have been talking to a glitching bot. Apparently they forgot to sort out bill as it fell on a weekend?! At this point we gave up, with trying to get answers and moved our account to a competent company. We have now had our final bill from them, based on the ¬£61 pound for 4 days usage the bill would have been a further ¬£100 per month‚Ä¶ and we can‚Äôt speak to anyone as it a the weekend,  some customer service this!

We have been having problems with octopus energy for a year now.We purchased a derelict house to renovate.
We had constant high bills when the electric was not being used .The gas was used once to check the boiler was working and they did We had used ¬£478 !!!
We recently sold the house in November. Three days later a direct debit was set up by one of the octopus energy team to take ¬£478 not for gas but for electric which had been settled. Surely this is fraud as we did not authorise this direct debit and did not owe the money .I dread to think how many other people are being scammed by this bent company .They even have fake reviews on trust pilot to lure people in .

We moved to Octopus when we had an EV on order, as they offered an Intelligent rate which allows you to charge the car overnight at a lesser rate.

We were advised that once the car arrived we should call to be switched onto the Intelligent tariff. That's what I did.

The call handler advised we would be getting an email with Terms & Conditions to accept withing 24 hours, and that we would then get an option in the Octopus app to perform a test change.

After 2 days neither happened. I chased via phone, and after 6 days was told it was being passed to another team. The other team emailed and said the option would be on the APP....basically just sent me full circle.

By this point, as you might imagine we are quite frustrated.

Another call to Octopus to register a complaint, and the call handler advised that he was aware of other customers with the same problem, and was unsure how to resolve it. Advised he would call or email me by mid-morning the next day.... that didn't happen.

Massively frustrated, and let down. I realise problems can happen....but to be fobbed off and let down is inexcusable.

Octopus told me when I originally signed up 3 years ago that my monthly bill would be about ¬£35. I soon realised it was well over ¬£100 (in a 2-bed flat) and today it is more like ¬£400-500 a month! I have been checking all points of usage and am now living without heating but the bills are still ridiculously high. Energy companies want to blame it all on the Ukrainian war.

 I was on a single tarriff, but they billed for day and night with night usage being 0 to the current single reading which equates to over ¬£2000.  I emailed them to query and have had absolutely no response in over 2 weeks.  Direct debit is now cancelled until they explain their billing.

Octopus upped the DD in October 22 (The support payment started then) to their 2023 'estimated' usage to over ¬£230.00 (you had to tell them not to), and then deducted the Energy Support Payment.
Means that Octopus effectively 'pocketed' over 70% of the ESP while the customer received only just over 25% support! They then try to tell you they don't make money out of it!!!
They certainly save, or earn, any interest - a devious, unscrupulous tactic and take customers for idiots. How they portray themselves as honest is beyond me.

Same problem as other 1 star reviews.

There is a cost of living crisis at the moment and so the last thing customers need is, having to contact Octopus energy about erratic balance generation.

I‚Äôve always paid on time every month. Ever since the great energy reset around April 1st 2022 ‚Äî I‚Äôm sent my bill but as soon as I pay it I immediately receive notice of a new additional ‚Äúcurrent balance‚Äù.

No one needs the unnecessary stress of sorting out monthly energy bills. Purposeful confusion (especially regarding numbers) is a strategy for scamming customers out of their money.

I sent an email to customer services regarding extremely rude and incompetent customer service during the pandemic (Octopus/Cooperative energy not informing Lowri Beck of energy switch) and did not receive any reply. When I called and asked to speak to a manager, I was told she was busy and would contact me (she never did).

Dishonesty is never a good policy!

This is in addition to my one star review below. Smart meter doesn't work, octopus trying to bill me ¬£2,200 for less than four months electricity, when it cost me on average ¬£300 when the smart meter worked. Well deserving of two one star reviews.

Well where do i start at the beginning I thought they was brilliant i recommended 3 price then started to relise my bill after my recommendations where far higher I'm guessing to cover the ¬£100 reward so i stopped recommending then for the past 3 years in trying to rectify my smart meter and bill reading being significantly different more than half I was offered ¬£250 compensation last year and they said it was all rectified as the smart meter had wrong tariff I mean did it really take 2 years to sort that out after me having to do endless tests then it wasn't resolved and the last year I've been trying to find out why my bills are so high they just ignore all correspondance so i went to the energy ombusman to get them to sort this out so they then decide to take back the ¬£250 good gesture they paid last year and also take back ¬£100 energy support fund they credited to add to insult all because I've raised a complaint this is still ongoing but once the ombusman have rectified this I will be leaving for sure terrible company to deal with

Utterly shocking, avoid at all costs. My smart meter hasn't sent reads for three months, I have no doubt this is a ploy to charge me full rate to charge my EV overnight. After initially being told I'd receive a credit for difference in rate I'm now told to 'read the terms and conditions' and no credit will be provided. A terrible choice for anyone with an EV, much better alternative options out there.

Absolutely horrendous service. I was transfered to Octopus from Avro energy and thought there were no issues. A few months into the contract I get hit with a 1400+ bill out of the blue, a random charge supposedly as Avro mismanaged readings, payments etc. Bloody disgusting.

Octopus pride themselves for their customer service. Don't believe a word you hear! I spotted serious issues with my account history and although their customer reply 'turnaround' is claimed to be the best, they have ignored my complaint and have not contacted me. They also raise your direct debit without any prior warning and give you no option to discuss the matter - in my case they raised the direct debit over 120%. Can't reply to 'how quick...' [see below] as they never contacted me.

They provide timely reminders for meter readings & make it simple to enter the information. They send an email for the amount due for the payment very quickly after the readings are submitted & the date when payment will be taken from your bank account - essentially a very efficient company with excellent systems in place.

I have been with Octopus energy as a supplier of last resort for around 10 months now and have found their prices competitive and more so as a SOLR when they could have put me on a much worse deal, and I'd have no control over it. Their pricing is fair and open and due to this I cannot see me moving from them in the current climate. if they stay this competitive, I will be remaining with this company when my contract is up for renewal in April.

I was with Octopus for a few years, then closed my account when I moved. In spite of paying direct debit, they charged me as if I were not, and only repaid me after I disputed my final bill. Fast-forward 15 months and I have received a message from a debt-collection agency saying I owe over ¬£800 in unpaid energy bills. Someone new moved into my old flat and didn't tell Octopus, so they just decided to put the account back in my name without telling me. I have spent the past three weeks trying to sort this out as it's on me to prove I no longer live there, in spite of doing all the right things by closing my account.

I have been with Octopus Energy for many years on a rented property all bills included.  Only recently I decided not to rent out the property anymore.  To cut the story short. Originally we had five tenants. Most moved and only had two left in the property staying till the end of their contracts (3 more months), but I was still paying the same estimated bill every month of ¬£250. the last time I checked my account I had ¬£869 in credit.  I spoke to customer care and explained my situation but was told to leave the monthly bills as it is and when I give the final reading, they will calculate the final usage and credit me back the money. Which makes sense, so I lead to believe. So, I carry on given the reading month, and the same amount was still taken out of my account monthly. When the last tenant moved out of the property, I looked into my account and noticed I was now ¬£730 in credits, which was odd.  When I  submitted my final reading after the last tenant moved out. a few days later I got sent a final reading credit of ¬£37!  When I question it, they gave me some random BS about the harsh winter we had, and OE didn't calculate the reading and only charge us the standard, and that was why my final bills were so high...
after speaking and listening to countless of their customer care service team members, I gave up and accept the ¬£37 credits.  They promised that I will be refunded within 14 working days. Over a month later I still didn't receive my refund I follow up on the original email chain. Another customer care replied and asked me for my account number, telephone details and email address. Followed by the last reading ""which was all on the email chain"" as I pointed out.  Then they told me that I need to send them proof of the reading I took on the end date because it doesn't match what they have on record...! Luckily I took photos of the reading, so I was able to send them. Since then I have not heard anything back from OE. This has been going back and forth for over three months, and I am still in process of chasing for my refund.   

If anyone out there knows how I can resolve this issue with Octopus Energy, please contact me at:  quango77@icloud.com

I was contacted by octopus on 28th June to state that they were investigating my account as there were duplicate accounts, requesting further information from myself.

I logged into my account on the app. My direct debit has been cancelled by them and octopus had not taken the direct debit of ¬£157 for 3 months. I had no notification of this cancellation. The tariff was removed from my account, I was unable to submit readings etc. all of the payments I had made over the year had been credited to my account.

I replied to the email requesting somebody to contact me to inform me what was happening, several days later, an email from them with no information as to what was happening, informing me to contact customer services if I wanted to speak to someone.

I contacted customer services who initially told me that I had nothing to worry about, the account had been looked into and that the credit had been added back to my account as there was a duplicate. I was told not to be concerned and my account was in ¬£1236 credit. Prior to ending the call and being asked to provide a gas meter reading, I was then told that octopus were confused about my account, it was being investigated and were looking into it and to await further contact from them. I was told not to worry and it would be sorted out.

Since then, I had sparse emails from them offering no help or information at all.

Initially I was told that‚Äôs after looking at my account, it was sorted and I was ¬£116 in credit. A couple of days later, this then changed to ¬£706 in debit with an apology and no explanation as to how they had reached this amount. Then when questioned and asked why I was no longer on the fixed rate I was previously, my bill is now ¬£860 in debit! 

I‚Äôve now received an email stating they will be collecting a direct debit of ¬£734 this month!

Absolute shambles of a company, no customer service skills, unable to explain any of their actions, not a clue what they are doing! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

Our whole experience with transferring to Octopus has been awful. We have been passed to several different people with no one solving the issue. The previous supplier has now received an updated for our usage which is entirely wrong. Lack of communication has been the key and being  passed to different people has created miscommunication. There seems no coherent resolution to the problem. In addition Octopus has also not refunded an excessive balance after our request to do so. Overall a miserable experience and causing considerable stress. From our experience I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend.

Moved from Octopus to Avro for better rates a couple of years ago as the smart meter didn't work for Octopus Go rate (and their billing sucked). A year on (June '21), returned from Avro (before they went bust) to Octopus because they had sorted out the Go rate.... Not the billing however.

When I left before, Octopus continued billing me with estimated readings. A while later they 'refunded' me as it had gone past cut off date, but the nightmare customer services/billing combination has excelled itself. Justified theft, price hikes and the common sense of a snake when questioned.

This time they have sent an email telling me my Go rate has ended and my charges are to go from ¬£160 to ¬£360 a month. Then a few days on, decided to recreate a backbill of ¬£500 based on an ESTIMATE they used incorrectly (and previously refunded) after a dodgy final meter reading Avro sent them over A YEAR AGO - even though I sent them a correct one at the time. This estimated figure just fell (a couple of days) in the '12 month backbilling' period, but the readings they are quoting are over 18 months old.
The 12 month back-billing rule doesn't apply to them apparently, nor does data protection - as they felt free to access my old Avro account, even though it was never theirs - it was closed before the takeover - without my knowledge. There they found Avro had made a mistake - and now they are billing me for it, for their company's gain - at a higher rate than Avro would have charged if they had billed correctly...
They tried to tell me I had used 2000KwH in a week - but when I proved I hadn't, they admitted they had been in the archived billing and said they are right to bill me for it because I should have paid it to Avro. (I never missed a payment with Avro, I gave them readings and I was not in debt with them - they input really random estimated readings). Basically, they are happy to drag out the old archives - even from old companies, and find any backbilling opportunities to cash in - OffGen stopped this in 2018, but they are continuing whilst customers are at their lowest. 

They are sick and evil, disinterested in facts and figures unless they can massage them for their gain.

The replies avoided the issue and requested I did meter checks repeatedly, which I did, I sent images and screenshots, went backwards and forwards - emailed, phoned, and spoke to several different people, who all missed the point and told me I had a smart meter... I even begged for help, to escalate the complaint - and was treated like a thief.

Where do I start. First get email saying I am paying the correct monthly payment but had fallen behind....by 1500 pounds! Question this and a few days later, balance is 2700 in debt! Wrote very strong email with evidence of charges (2 separate charges of 1300 and 1500 for the same period!) And wait for over a week with no response to finally see my bill is back to 30 in debt (which after the issues I have had, I am willing to let go). No update, apology or anything. Absolute mess, even wanted me at the start to pay a one off payment of 1500 to help my account, this from the person apparently looking after the account. How they won any awards astounds me.

I intend to complain to every body possible. Starting with Trading Standards. But let‚Äôs make no mistake. Government allowed this , with FULL KNOWLEDGE that people will suffer unmeasurably. They ALLOWED those energy companies to raise their prices 600% (that‚Äôs what my bill has raised by despite same usage as before) and now are offering our pitiful ¬£400 as one off payment.

They are the worst company to deal with.  Their opening hours are so short, there is little time from my bus working day to call.  When you do, you have to start over with your concern as there is no ownership.  Even when you email they say 1.6 days to respond, on average I am waiting 3 days.   To then be told they have tried calling me; no missed calls or vms!!!  The meter is not working and they have tried to bill me for essentially 24,000 kw over the last 6 months, for a 4 hr cheap EV night rate.

I was with AVRO, transferred automatically by the government onto a variable green tariff, which apparently by passes all of the limits on pricing. I was paying ¬£135 a month to Avro, which way is up to ¬£180 went to ¬£220 before they went bust.

There is no way to escape this pricing loop hole because there are now no providers offering variable rate tariffs.

On top of that, I recommend to everyone to use third parties where you have written quotes as they directly will offer you the worse possible tariffs and will deceive you like is going to be a great offer.
Having a complaint with them regarding the above mentioned, their ""professional"" answer is to admit nothing and blame me for everything!!!
Definitely will never use again their services and make sure to tell every business partner and any other person about my experience with them. I just agreed to another 12 month contract after my bills went again up 50% to turn out that actually, there are companies out there that offer 30% less tariffs and this is frustrating to see how your own company rip us off!!!
Really sad how you can change the entire customer experience through bad support and ignorant staff !!!

Complaint number 215204

Thank you for a ""great"" experience!!!

Unbelievable incompetence

Just when I thought that my complaint against Octopus Energy had been resolved, I received a bill which continued to contain the absurd estimate of our annual gas cost: the nonsensical ¬£9,247.07. Although, after more than seven months of uncertainty and worry, Octopus has finally charged me and my husband for our actual gas usage (we were transferred to the company from the failed Avro Energy on 26th September 2021) ‚Äì and the amount appears correct ‚Äì whoever was handling our complaint never bothered to correct this insane estimate of our annual gas cost. Although we are no longer shocked and distressed because Octopus has freely admitted its mistake, we still don‚Äôt know what the projected annual cost of our gas will be and cannot believe the company‚Äôs incompetence.

Used to be with the CO-OP but they seem to have thrown the towel in and I've now been thrown in with this lot. I used to pay quarterly on receipt of the bill, with the CO-OP, but this lot want a payment every month. I now pay every two months. Their latest way to 'pass' customers off is to threaten legal action 9 days before payment is due.Totally unwarranted aggressive attitude.
Wish I could give zero stars. This company stinks.

Been reading all the negative reviews on here and must say they are totally different to my experience.  I was in the process of joining Avro last September when they went bust and switched to Octopus.  Avro of course took my first payment the day they went bust.  It has taken a long time to get my account with Octopus sorted with only getting an actual bill this last week but without the credit paid to Avro.  An email to Sanin of Octopus, who incidentally has continued to respond to any emails I have sent since last October expeditiously, resulted in a request to me to provide screen shot from Avro website.  That done and 2 days later credit showing on account online.  Yes it has taken months to sort out but in the present climate with all companies going bust the remaining companies have been busy.  Yes it is frustrating but I cannot fault Octopus for sorting this out.  I now have a large bill for the period from September last to now but have paid that with money I saved while sorting out the bill and not paying a monthly direct debit.  It must be who you deal with if you are having problems.  Kudos to Sanin

I have been approached by one of your Canvassers namely Dave recently.  He was so patient and had a lovely manner as I began to get political and annoyed by the price increases of other companies, and other energy sources ie. BP who are making a profit out of the working man.  Dave was so understanding and I gave him my details as I know Octopus Energy is not making the big profits as other companies are.  So I hope this review is seen and appreciated re. Dave (Doncaster).

Switching to this company is the worst move I ever made! They are a JOKE! Started me off on ¬£80 per month (which was my actual usage with my previous supplier) then it went up to over ¬£100 per month within weeks of joining, with me being told this was to 'help me' not get into any debt! Long story short, my bill came today, this month is over ¬£180 and they say this is for my own benefit!!!!!!!  They bill you for 'predicted' usage for the summer, based on usage for Winter and they are not helpful in any way.. Also, they tell me that they hiked up my prices to make sure I was not in debt.. OK, that makes sense.. so WHY am I ¬£200 in debt???? Madness is all I can conclude.. please do not trust these people it is all a lie!!

Beware of Octopus Energy!

Despite its glowing Trustpilot reviews - it really has been dodgy in its dealings with me, and I doubt those reviews are even genuine.
Octopus overcharged me - not at first - but hit me with a 'charge-back' scam about 10 months into the contract which swallowed-up over ¬£300 of credit I'd accrued. 

Octopus also text me on a couple of occasions, to give the date & time of free electricity - or electricity I'd receive payment for using, as it was surplus and needed removing from the national grid - but despite me asking, Octopus refused to tell me what I'd received for using such electricity, and I suspect I was conned into using 'free electricity' etc that I was actually charged for!

Paid ¬£102 per month for dual supply last year. Had an email from
them in Febryary to say my flexibe plan will be increasing to ¬£136.54 in April.
Suddenly last week I get another email telling me my payment will be ¬£318 per month from April 1st but if I switch to Octopus Loyal plan my payment will be ¬£307.
This is a colossal increase either way and is based on estimated usage but surely the reason we have meters is to show actual usage and any charges should be based on that

Ive had no billing for gas since January due to faulty smart meter.

As they have decided to increase my bill by 50% plus taking it to over ¬£300/mth i need to know what im using but it seems that they are not bothered to call orcemail me as to why the meter is not working.

My warm home discount failed and needed to be checked not their fault but they ha e handled it really badly. I uploaded everything they asked for and they failed to tell me  they needed further evidence.

I'm convinced their trustpilot reviews are fake... 

I have had multiple issues...

1. took over a month to install smart meters (had to chase and they only respond when you post a 1 star trustpilot rating
2. gas meter predictably doesnt work with the IHD display
3. had to wait almost a week for their ""support"" to reply and their response was ""have you tried turning it on and off again""

Why is customer service always so pathetic in the uk, its like a disease.

the fact that the reviews on reviews.io are bad, but the trustpilot ones are ""perfect"" suggests to me that trustpilot is fake.

I was changed to Octopus after my existing provider Avro went into liquidation. Having noticed an excessive electricity charge (resulting in a 30% increase in my bills) was applied to my account I phoned to ask for an explanation, as I live alone and nothing has changed in relation to my electricity consumption. I was told that this would be investigated, and they would come back to me after the account had been audited.

I have heard nothing, so the increase remains with no explanation to why.  Awful service, do not believe what you are told by the customer services team.

Hi, my name is ‚Äî‚Äî-I joined octopus energy  as a customer on  October 2021.   On Economy 7 day and night tariff, smart meter fitted 03.11.2021.  I am having storage heaters fired on a grant system so the company need  a bill  that shows day and night tariff. I called your company and was told I could not get a bill as I‚Äôm not on that tariff? I was then told it would take a few days, nothing happened, I then called complaints who said  they would sort this on the 27.01.22  and it would take 10 days at the most, Efrain assured me that he would keep checking this, also I told him I need a bill showing night and day rates as soon as this was completed, no update whatsoever. To check on this I called today 07.01.2022. I spoke with Abbie who told me that the process had not gone through? So nothing was done in these 10 days I have waited! Abbie said she would chase this up.I then waited another 4 hours no one got back to me no updates no email no nothing?  I called back spoke to Michael, who said  he couldn‚Äôt really help but he would speak to Abbie, I then asked could I be called back and his answer was it could take up to a week before someone got back to me‚Ä¶ I then asked for the floor manager, his reply not available, then I asked for head of complaints manager name, he said he did not know?

Just received a threatening email as my bill is outstanding. This is not my fault. They do not provide an automated telephone payment service. I tried to phone to pay on several occasions. While on hold the noise from the so called music has been unbearable making me end the waiting. I suffer from bad pains in the head and this noise makes it worse. They obviously do not have enough people to answer the phone. It did not used to be so and I used to be impressed with the service. Far from it now. But they prefer to blame the customer for their lack of good service.
When you have to pay expensive bills you do not want the provider to give you grief. 
Now looking for a company with better service if that exists.

I am having the same experience with Octopus lots of lies and no transparency lately, but I am on a fixed rate until April and there are no other reputable Companies to go too right now, and they know this so they are trying to take advantage of their customers I have a Disability and I know they are aware of it. Please some body who is capable, get a Solicitor involved...

I am on a fixed super green tariff but octopus seems to want to constantly raise my monthly payments by at least double the amount of what I agreed to pay.
being on a low income this is totally out of my budget . they have tried to do this twice now and I have only been with them for 10 months. I thought this company was supposed to be better for people who have less incomes so unable to be with the ""big 4"" energy suppliers, but it seems that now they have started to grow, they are beginning to get greedy and more money driven. I give monthly meter readings as agreed but my bill says it's an estimated bill ? this I don't understand as it should be totally accurate with the readings given should it not ?

Bad service and unprofessional! Octopus energy speaks with other people about your account (without doing due diligence who they are) even if they are not the account holder - a clear breach of data security. They don't follow your instructions, and when they stuff up, they lie to you about it to try and cover it up. Your customer service staff need training. Not impressed. This is a review from an actual customer and not an ""invited"" review!

had this 'back charge' after coming from AVRO ( no choice)
Was ¬£495 in credit which ran out ~ 21 Jan 2022
Got bill from Octopus for ¬£33.13 which I paid in full with debit card,  got another bill next day for 1p. Tried to pay this crazy bill but it wouldn't go through their system. Didn't want to be blacklisted for 1p, I don't know where the 1p bill came from but after a few choice emails to them as a gesture of goodwill they dropped the 1p charge. Should be renamed Mickey Mouse outfit

Octopus Energy is to be avoided like the plague! 
As my flat is seldom used, Octopus Energy had been overcharging me each month, which added-up to a credit of just over ¬£300 on my account. 
But yesterday, that reduced to just over ¬£60, after Octopus Energy 'back-charged' me for the summer months - its revised August bill being at least three times more than I would actually use at that time of year.
In my opinion, Octopus Energy is a disreputable company, and is to be avoided at all costs!

We have been with octopus energy for a few years now and never wanted to go elsewhere, as we have found them to be the best energy provider we have ever been with. 
Customer service‚Ä¶ no long waits and professional care and compassion above and beyond. 
During lockdown we had no problems getting through. I have never had anyone negative deal with me. I have always been treated courteously and fairly. Bills are easy to understand online.

Trying to get a bill out of them for the actual energy used is not happening and they constatly keep saying you balance of ¬£300 needs to be paid but in no relaiton to any bills/ They've just sold my 'balance' debt to a debt collector and i'm still asking for an actual bill based on readings!

Absolutely awful company who we joined last October due to Bulbs problems with whom we had had excellent service for years.

Octopus repeatedly messed up our transfer, We registered as needing extra help due to a high usage of disability equipment, told them we are pension credit claimants and on the core group for the warm home ¬£140.
 grant
Twice they have demanded evidence of the entitlement letter from the DWP which has been sent by email great email trace here as absolute proof, phoned up yet again on Monday to be told yet again that they do not have to pay out onto our account till 22nd March which is the last date payment must be credited to our account.

So octopus appear to be holding onto the DWP funding so wonder if they now have financial problems whilst we sit and shiver. Got told by the customer service person on the phone use less electricity, difficult when I am paralysed and rely on it to live.

Wow where did I start? 
I joined Octopus Energy in 2020/21 and to say it was a rocky start was an understatement. Being an EV driver it made sense to join on their GO tariff. I did wait several months for a smart meter which quickly developed a fault ( turns out this wasn‚Äôt Octopuses fault- the meter company hadn‚Äôt even commissioned it from the get go) months passed and I was getting hugely frustrated. Coupled with the fact the meter company booked appts and failed to show on 3 separate occasions I lost my patience. Ended up ranting when I received notice of new charges of a ridiculous amount. Finally a lovely lady named Resh got in touch and became my first point of call. She worked so hard to get our meter issues sorted. Turns out the meter was faulty so this was replaced and now finally it is working. A rocky start which wasn‚Äôt really their fault despite me thinking they were to blame. Now Resh is a credit to the company - she worked so hard looking at our usage and despite not benefitting from the off peak tariff - calculated our bill to include an estimate and amend charges. She has been available day and night to ensure our satisfaction and treated us with the upmost respect and care. I would highly recommend them for going above and beyond to help a disgruntled customer. I hope Octopus CEO knows what a credit she is. We are so grateful for her help. I was considering leaving initially but because of her help and understanding I know I am with the BEST energy company. Hope this helps others.

I moved into a my new house in December 2020. There was no lead for the smart meter I inherited. I was delayed in contacting Octopus has I was recovering from Covid. When I eventually contacted them in March 2020, I was told to chase up the cable from the previous owner. This was impossible, then rather grudgingly they agreed to send me one, that was I'm April 2020! I have continued to chase this up, and had excuse after excuse for why I haven't received it. In understand supply issues, but I don't understand poor communication. Around November time, someone apologised, after I had chased them up, and said it would take about 3 weeks to be sent out. It's now 12th January 2022,and 10 months on I haven't received a new smart meter or capable. Yet, despite this I pay my bill on time every month. I'm now fed up and frustrated with the whole process. All I want is smart meter that I can use. I'm still struggling with long Covid, and chasing up a smart meter and cable is something I don't have energy for.

Joined in July last year. I gave meter readings‚Ä¶everything was fine. Then they told me my smart meters were working I recently got a ¬£140.00 fuel allowance added to account. Suddenly my Electricity bill was under estimated by 285 units??? I‚Äôm a pensioner and this came as a major shock. I feel sick to my stomach and can‚Äôt eat. I only use Electric for cooking shower and lights TV I use one lamp with an Led 3w candle bulb. I use a Halogen glass oven for cooking. I‚Äôm on my own. I‚Äôve had my gas off for days and yet it still shows up on the usage chart from 6 in the morning when I‚Äôm still in bed. How can this happen? I thought they were good when I joined but they‚Äôve taken my money. one bill says I have ¬£65.00 left in credit. I had ¬£139 left one bill ¬£56.00 other ¬£30.00. I should have money left I have 65p I‚Äôm going to look at one of the bigger companies again. I don‚Äôt want to be with a Company that robs pensioners. I got in contact..it was like when you used to have to go on to a broadband company turn the router off ..wait..switch back on. I was told to switch everything in the house off at the mains‚Ä¶.wait‚Ä¶and switch back on..if the meters moved it‚Äôs faulty. I wish I had just kept giving readings now irrespective of smart meters. I bloody hate them. Anyway Octopus won‚Äôt be bothered now‚Ä¶as soon as they get big‚Ä¶the trouble starts..it‚Äôs all about the money NOT the customer that gives it to them. Looks like I‚Äôve been charged twice in December!

I transferred to Octopus a couple of years ago due to the tarifs lower than other suppliers.
I deal with my own account online,submit my own meter reads and add DD change dates and amounts according to charges and not massively being in credit. 

As a customer I take responsibility for my readings and controlling my account. Understandably not blaming the price rises on the energy supplier. I understand the system thats why.

Chole please contact me and get the job done to get back your 5 star

The company ignore what I said. As we have ceased the service and switched to other provider on 6 October. And we‚Äôve transferred on 24 October.
We have paid the last outstanding balance from 27 September to 10 October. And the company repeatedly bill us from 1 October to 30 October. Also they asked for 23 November.
And I informed that company that we have paid all the bill.

Chole said she will help me get the job done, and ask me for 5 star. And I gave her 5 star. However, I just received the company bill charging me from 1 October to 23 November.

Yet, Chole has confirmed that 24 October would be the last bill.

So the Octopus Energy ignored what I said, and repeatedly charge me. And ignore my payment from 27 September to 9 October is paid.

I declare that I am not liable to this company. But the company persists their fault.

It is a money vampire company. And please never use it.

We've been with Octopus for 7 months and yet to receive any form of bill or any indication of how much we owe.  All we can do is load some money onto our account for the fear of getting some huge bill.  We had to cancel the Direct Debit because of this also. 24 hours later we get a terse e-mail demanding we contact them and pay what we owe in 5 days.  We off course asked how much????  S 

Octopus told us 6 months ago there was a problem with the initial reading meter readings given, even though they say the meter is working well. They informed us the meters were being changed but that got cancelled. We've asked numerous times why this taking so long to resolve and about the money we owe, and will we be expected to pay a one off huge bill.  They've dragged their feet over it and refuse to give a straight answer. 

We still after 7 months don't know what their problem is, maybe ineptitude, who knows!  We do know the customer service is very poor, it's lengthy and uninformative.  Their inability to understand how this is a problem for us and lack of any coherent explanation to alleviate the issues is bad.

Ordered a conversion to smart metering, both electricity and gas, last March 2021. First installation appointment failed. Had to wait a further month for an alternative. Engineer installed new meters but, as it turned out, had failed to commission the system. Exactly an other month before a more competent engineer arrived to complete the work.
Since then we have had lengthy periods when Octopus have not been able to supply us with the data from either of the meters. Because we are on their GO tariff this means that it is not possible for a statement to be provided with separate night/day consumption data. I have emailed Octopus support on numerous occasions. Replies can take many days to appear. Meanwhile we are stuck with a system that does not work. One reply stated that it is a condition of the GO tariff that a data failure will mean that we will be charged on a standard tariff rate.
Octopus may claim to be ""green"" etc but I suggest that incompetent may also be a description.

Joined approx 4 months ago and my monthly payments were gas and electric ¬£108 and i did think this was a little low but based on my previous years consumption they said it was correct.Had a statenent for 2nd of Aug that i was ¬£30 minus and on 3rd of Sept ¬£54 minus ! On the 6th of Sept i get an e-mail saying iam ¬£445 minus (never missed any payments) and my DD are increasing to ¬£245 a month ? Yes more than double my current payments.How have i gone from ¬£54 in debt on 3rd sept to ¬£445 in debt in 3 days ? Im horrified as i was enticed in by a low tarrif which is obviously a ploy to get you on board then shaft you.Im angry and upset as ive always paid my bill on time and correctly and this has upset me greatly and reading other reviews it seems im stuck especially with whats currently going on.Very worried.

I was quoted ¬£95.84 per month but when I proceeded to sign up this amount changed to ¬£154.00 per month. I contacted customer services and they asked for a copy of the email that was sent to me. I forwarded the email to them immediately but have heard nothing. It is not acceptable to receive an email with a quote giving the customer false hope. The email states my quote is ¬£95.84 per month, so how can this change within minutes???

I have been with Octopus over a year, and it is the best move I have ever made. Have now mived to Green Energy Supply with them which is excellent- best ever price for Dual Fuel I have ever had. Excellent customer service who are always happy to help, also polite, and friendly, which gives me so much confidence in having Octopus as my energy supplier. A huge thank you to all. üëå.

If I could put 0 on here I would but the lowest is 1 so I‚Äôve opted for tht. Absolute scam of a company, over charging by more than triple and has take over a year for them to correct the actual readings. Very evasive if at all responding to e mails which when thy have responded are all templated! If u r with this company scrutinise every unit u actually use and cross check it with ur bill as they r quite happy to refer to a debt company even after thy agreed the bill is not correct by over ¬£350!! Avoid at all costs!!

Great for switching but heaven help you if there‚Äôs a problem. Worst customer service I‚Äôve every come across. We‚Äôre supplying duel fuel then switch my electricity supply to another supplier without telling me. They send a email saying I wanted to switch and I told them I didn‚Äôt but the ignored this and moved it anyway!! But still confined to take full payment every month! Not until I asked why no electricity bill did they say ooops!! 8 months it took to sort or so I thought but no! Today received a gas bill but no electricity. So here we go again. Transferring back to British Gas where at least they have a customer service!! Stay well clear of OctopusEnergy if you value your sanity!

Octopus are OK but chaotic when things are anything other than straightforward.
When I joined them ,they seemed to have great trouble accepting the opening gas meter reading. When I moved to another provider 2 years later, they recorded the wrong closing gas meter reading and 3 months later they appear INCAPABLE of sorting out an obvious typo. Paralysed by inertia, they are.
Beware of Octopus, because its tentacles get very tied up.

I transferred my business energy supply to Octopus in Jan 2021.  It's been a terrible mistake on my part.  Octopus constantly debit a greater sum of cash from my business account than it should do due to billing for the same energy twice.  They agree - they have refunded me nearly ¬£4,500 since this summer to take account of it.  Now again, this week they are about to debit cash from my account for energy used not this month (I'm on monthly billing) but right back to April.  I rang them today using the number on the back of my business invoice.  The operator was very professional but was in a Domestic energy team so could not help - I did suggest she make a suggestion that invoices carry a more relevant phone number.  She tried to put me through to someone else.  I put the phone down at 22 minutes.  I called again.  Quickly answered and within 2 minutes the second account handler agreed that the account is laden with errors (as I put it 'chaotic' but as she put it, 'does seem double billed').  She said she would reverse this week's huge impending bill and get the account reviewed by an Operations Manager (as per their process described on p4 of the invoice).  But this is the third time I have had to complain bitterly that this energy company appears unable to supply energy and invoice no more than the amount x tariff in return.

I strongly advise anyone considering moving to Octopus to hesitate.  The bills are nice and easy to read - yes !  But they are rarely for the correct amount of money.  As a result I am having to manage my cash flow in a way that ensures there is more money available for ridiculous and inappropriate direct debits made by Octopus.

I wish I had never signed up.

1 out of 10 for nice easy to read bills.
0 out of 10 for eroding a customer's soul with what appears to be a naive administrative system behind their business and all the signs that the organisation is unable to learn from errors.

I have been an Octopus Energy customer about five years. I rate then as a super company, why? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
I pay less now on standing order than I did five years ago with a different provider;
The billing is straightforward;
The choice of different tariffs is limited and therefore makes the choice easier and less confusing;
The bill will tell you if there is a cheaper tariff for you and how much you may save;
If I have a query or question, I e-mail and get a result quickly and clearly;
I have recommended a few people and get rewarded for my trouble, which I would do regardless of the reward. 
Thank you Octopus!

Octopus only took on electric initially even though we requested both gas and electric. Bill direct debits were only calculated on electric usage so they took too little by direct debit although the overall amount owing did account for both hence we got into over ¬£500 in debt to them. I tried to change payments but their automatic system still only wanted it to reflect electric payments. I had to phone them to request putting up payment. The smart meters I requested 4 times eventually got fitted about 7 months later!! Smart meter for gas won't link to in house display or them. They keep fobbing us off with comments they are fixing it but many weeks later it still doesn't work. A meter man came to check the work of meter installer but said he couldn't do anything about it not transmitting nothing to do with him! Very frustrating right from day 1.

So, all started well with a half-decent tariff, however, it looks as though Octopus Energy's own success is catching up with them and now they lag behind with awful Customer Service for current customers.
They have grown quickly and now become exactly like everybody else in the industry (slow, unresponsive with half-decent marketing to keep the churn coming in), and don't get me started about their Smart Meters!
The tariffs are now as expensive as everyone else so they do not stand out. With this though you would expect them to continue to push the USP of decent Customer Service however, unfortunately, that has fallen spectacularly (unlike their prices!)

I had a Smart Meter fitted in early March as I had an EV on order and wanted to take advantage of the EV Tariff, however, I kept being billed a huge amount via DD per month.
I contacted Customer Service through a variety of different channels but got nothing back for a month. The DD's kept rolling around and despite me updating them with meter readings and asking why they were not taking the Smart Meter Reading values (over ¬£50 less than the Octopus estimates) there was still silence.
After a barrage of emails and phone calls, I was contacted in early April... oh great! I thought a resolution?!? Absolutely not, sporadic auto-generated emails are all you will get with an apologetic overworked excuse.
I have now been getting apologetic emails from Lora for around 4 months with nothing being achieved apart from excuses for other departments.

It is now August and 6 months after and I have still not been billed for the amounts showing on my Smart Meter despite an engineer coming out two weeks ago and confirming it was fixed within 10 minutes of being here!
I am still no closer to an EV Tariff and I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere in September when my tariff is done. I would advise anyone else thinking these guys as great to do the same.
They now owe me over ¬£400 (which my account is in credit) and have confirmed I cannot get this back until they confirm my Smart Meter Readings!!! Which they are ""waiting back from a colleague"" to see if it is working before being able to do anything. I am so fed up, what a waste of my life dealing with these guys.

How about you pick up the phone to your colleague and ask them!? Then it might take less than a month to get back to me and you might not owe me ¬£450 and a huge chunk of my time and energy.

AVOID!

Since joining Octopus, I have had numerous problems. 1st meter readings taking by myself was not acknowledged and Octopus gave my old supplier completely wrong readings. Thankfully, I took photos as proof. I've made so many emails and phone calls as they're over charging me and are dragging their feet in refunding me. I have ended up spending hours of time between them and my old supplier to sort it out. Customer service was not at all helpful from Octopus. My old supplier has been amazing with trying to support me. Lesson learnt I should have stayed with my old supplier!

I signed on when I moved to a new house at the end of January. I asked for a smart meter, which was installed in mid-February. The bills looked very odd as they always said my balance was below zero although the negative amount shown was always deducted from my bank account. When I questioned this I received a convoluted reply, and decided to wait and see if it sorted itself out. 
It didn‚Äôt so when I received the bill for May I called, something they highly discourage, and learned that my smart meter had not been working since March. I was told it would be repaired within 7 days. I followed up and nothing had been done, and when still nothing was done by mid July I arranged to switch to another carrier. 
Although I had an email from them saying they were sorry to see me go, which would indicate they know I‚Äôm switching, I am still getting emails that they are supposedly working on the problem. 
I am switching to Good Energy as they seem very focused on protecting the environment, and I don‚Äôt see how they could have worse service than Octopus.

Applied for Outgoing Octopus 27 July 2020. It took until 7 April 2021 and a complaint to Ofgem to get a working SMART meter. I received the first bill in June, and guess what , not on Outgoing Octopus so I was not being paid for the electricity I had generated. OE said I have not applied for the tariff, until I sent them a copy of their email 27 July acknowledging my application. No apology. I have reapplied and they now require a document I sent to them previously. Re sent the document and 7 days later still no response. They really are hopeless.

In years I have never had a coherent bill. 3 times I have BEGGED them to help me and look into my billing and each time I e had to write to Greg Jackson to get any sort of attention.

So as an E7 customer they‚Äôve been charging me day rate for night usage and I‚Äôm all electric. On 3 occasions after much painstaking work from me to show them where they‚Äôve gone wrong I have eventually managed to get my money back and am now putting my faith in the ombudsman to sort this mess out.

Massively disappointed that my energy supplier, Octopus, has taken a partisan political stance by aligning with left-leaning news channels and boycotting a right-leaning news channel, GBNews.

The company has been successfully bullied by an unrepresentative mob on Twitter, and the partisan activist group ""StopFundingHate,"" which attacks any organisation that is not leftwing.

The rightwing Conservative government have presided over a decade of astonishing growth in renewable energy, with the UK reducing emissions faster than any other G7 nation. For Octopus to take a tacit leftwing political stance in the UK is deeply wrong on this basis.

Needed to switch away from them. New tariff too expensive. How they have verbally treated me,via the Resolver complaint's platform, is beyond compassion.
How they predicted what other suppliers would do to me ? How do they no ?
Their wording on their excuses, they defend their staff, so as a tiny little customer that l am, I'm taking them on, as it's tough in life, looking after and pleasing customers, but simple sums = no customers, no income for company.
Yes, we are not always right, but as a business, a lot of ""humble pie"" gets eaten, when it comes to pleasing customers !
So how are they allowed to predict what others may do and use word's that has offended ?
They tell me, they defend their word's, well l defend my right to fight back !
Behind their fluffy Duffy TV adverts, lay a company that has flaws, like us all, but getting them to admit them, is the fight you have !
12 month's of perfect custom from myself, to be treated like this, is not fair !
But silly billy me, thinking that loyalty counted for something.

Joined them at the beginning of March, having previously been with them for two years, but left for a year when the prices went up. Re-joined this year on a Tracker rate, which I understood. However the problem started when they used a 'starting reading' for my gas lower than the actual reading I gave them, which meant they were charging me for gas I had already paid for with my previous supplier. Sent e-mails that the person answering obviously did not understand as he kept telling me it wasn't Octopus's fault. After several e-mails (Their preferred communication method?), I gave up and a couple of phone calls later got a solution that they would credit my account with 'the cost of the gas' rounded up. Unfortunately, they did not tell me what rate they used as I am on a Tracker. However, things got worse when I gave my initial months readings and 9 days later I noticed a large amount money had been taken from my account, which was in credit. I tried to look at the bill, but there was none. After two frustrating telephone calls, I finally got to see the bill. However, when I looked at the bill, I saw, as expected, that the tariff rates varied daily for gas and electric. However, what I did not expect to see was my use varying, as I do not have a smart meter (Octopus are fitting one soon) and unless someone was entering my house every day to read the meter (??) they could not be accurate. It also appeared that the highest consumptions seemed to correspond with the highest tariff (Strange??). I had a long conversation with one of their representatives who could not explain why this should be so. After a long time with him trying to change me from the Tracker to a Fixed rate. He actually did it without my permission and it took a strongly worded e-mail to get it changed back. He could not explain why, so I asked him to get a manager to give me a call the next day.......Nothing! Sent another e-mail and was told by someone else they would get someone to contact/ring me today.....Nothing again. Rang again today 4 days after being 'promised' a call back and was told that they would e-mail a manager and they would be in contact.........Nothing again! I have asked for copies of my second telephone call and my last one. Bet they won't be forthcoming, despite the fact that they have to under GDPR? I have changed from liking Octopus to saying that their customer service is DISGUSTING! I will be leaving them and if you are thinking of joining them, DON'T!

Shortly after joining they wanted to increase my monthly payments considerably. Disingenuous means of getting you on board via low monthly payments only to increase once you're with them. Shady.

Wanted to join on Electric Vehicle Tarriff but have to have a smart meter first so they want me to go on a standard tarriff first that is nearly double the price and wait for smart meter to be fitted about 45 days. 
If you want my buissiness then you put me on the same price as EV Tarriff until you fit smart meter. Total rip off otherwise. Absolute rubbish service. So will go elsewhere.

Really not a good experience. They seem to want to constantly tinker with my monthly direct debit, taking more in the winter when I use more electricity and less in the summer when I use less, instead of a constant monthly amount across the year. Then I get emails asking for a card payment and then they appear unable to pick up the phone when I call them for help. I've only been with them for a few months and already I am fed up with them. I just want to pay a regular monthly amount over the course of a year, just like the other suppliers provide. Is that too much to ask?

Octopus quoted me ¬£55 per month for my electric, they took this automatically but didn‚Äôt actually send me bills. I chased this up and they sent me a bill for over ¬£900 pound for 4 months for a small 2bed flat. I have since had my payments increased to ¬£220 per month, I have complained I have called countless times and i have emailed. They have never responded to my emails, they continuously tell me some one is going to get back to me when I phone, there is clearly something really wrong with my meter or something but Octopus do not have a complaints procedure and don‚Äôt seem to be regulated and their default is to ignore people.

After power has been shut down by Western Power (due to a safety matter) in one of our rented accommodations, Western power advised an electrician needs to certify the safety of the connections etc and Octopus needed to be notified, which we did immediately. We were advised it was an emergency and they could send someone the following day. So we called back to check times for this engineer to be told that despite having now the all clear from an electrician, we weren't getting an engineer, its not an emergency and it will be raised next week, then be told further this morning that its deemed acceptable for us to wait OVER 2 weeks to get them out to update the meter before we can have everything switched back on. DISGUSTING. Already raised a complaint, even though it is deemed an emergency, they won't send anyone for over 2 weeks. As this is our income, who's paying for the loss of earnings while the place is empty?

I moved into a new flat and the Gas and Electricity was supplied by Scottish Power, I had read such good things about Octopus Energy, so I decided to switch after a while. Since then it's been hell. Two days after my switch I had a power cut in my flat which was not as a result of any trip, that is still a mystery. However when I got my first month's bill from Octopus, my Electric bill for a small two bed flat was ¬£80. The day after the power cut which was day 2 of when I joined Octopus, the reading showed that I used 200kwh of electricity in two days.  I emailed them but they ignored my emails repeatedly then I called and I got them to change my meter. After the meter was changed  a day after I had another power outage which again surged my meter reading because this time I took a picture of the difference. I queried the first bill and they repeatedly ignored my emails, I sent 4 emails given them at least a week to reply and I was repeatedly ignored. Eventually decided to call them and after being on hold for ages I got through someone who credited ¬£33 for the the inflated reading from the first month but still the readings does not make sense because it showing 3 times worth the usage Scottish Power was readings were which meant triple the bill. I was paying ¬£17 a month with Scottish Power for electric whereas with Octopus I am paying ¬£65 a month for just electric based on the readings and nothing has changed. In fact now I use less and turn absolutely everything off on the wall when not in use, apart from fridge freezer, boiler and wifi box. One weekend that I was not at home where the only appliance that is on is fridge freezer, Wi-Fi box and boiler, it says I use 9 kwh a day and on days I am at home where I work from home I use 11kwh. It just doesn't make any sense. The usage the meter is giving is what a 3 bedroom household with multiple people would use and I live by myself in a small two bed. I know I am being cheated and cannot proof it. Then last night I checked my meter reading like I do before midnight when I go to bed and it showed I had used just over 7kwh of electric that day and this was a typical day of me working from home. So explain how I can use less electric whilst at home than when I am not at home. I am switching providers. Stay away from this company.

Easy enough to join on their standard tariff but I wanted Octopus Go because I have just bought an EV. I was told to join on the standard tariff and then to ring back after a specific date once the change over was completed.  
I spent over 20 minutes on hold only to be told that I had to transfer over myself online.  I have been unable to do so since the link sent just took me through the steps to join Octopus all over again and just resulted in emails quoting me for the tariff I am already on. Despite further emails to Octopus no further guidance has been forthcoming.

I've read a lot of the bad reviews on here and am really surprised.  I've been with them for around 3yrs, had absolutely no problems.
They have been nothing but helpful and supportive especially through the pandemic.  Yes they have said they're raising my DD but I emailed them saying no, I can't afford it, they have always accepted my lower offer.  They are the only company to tell me I may be eligible for help as I'm on a low income and given it. They are responsive and listen.  Can only assume the people on here giving bad reviews got a 'bad apple' in an otherwise great barrel.

They rarely did meter readings ,all estimated. Which is not allowed. I received an email out of the blue today a SUNDAY saying you were doubling my direct debit. A fixed rate is a fixed rate. You are increasing based on what my previous company told you which is not allowed, data protection. You haver not done a meter reading since I joined you, all estimated.

I was switched to Octopus when Coop stopped providing the service in 2019. I had just had new SMETS2 meters, but Octopus had trouble connecting to them so I had to provide readings. Then Octopus said they were working but I noticed that the gas never changed. Eventually in February they installed new meters, but the Electricity doesn't connect to their system and the gas meter isn't even registered so I can't provide a reading. I am terrified I will suddenly get a huge bill. I have no idea what I have used. They take ages to respond and even longer to take action

I moved to a new house in December 2020 and switched from EDF to Octopus, from the 19/12 to the 04/01 EDF was still supplying our energy while the switch happened. I was then billed almost ¬£300 by EDF for this period. Lots of back and forth with EDF (Octopus were 0 help, they just wanted to triple my direct debit based on their wrong estimates and ignored my ACTUAL query instead) and turns out they estimated a meter reading that 3 months later in march, I still hadn't reached by a long shot. Raised a dispute, got everything rebilled. Octopus have messed around so much crediting and charging my account that I can't make head nor tail of it, 4 charges in 1 day, several in the space of a week. My account was ¬£176 in credit in January it is now ¬£9 even after them supposedly crediting my account as I was being hugely overcharged for the gas. I swear they've made it as confusing as possible on purpose. I've taken into account the winter buffer and have continued to pay direct debit, I submit meter readings once  a month if not moreso due to not trusting them to not mess it up. I wish i'd switched to Bulb instead as I never had any problems at all with them.

Six months after Octopus Energy insisted my faulty electricity meter had to be replaced with a Smart meter they still cannot get the meter working.

Left Octopus four months ago, and they still have not paid me what they owe me, and now they‚Äôve taken more money out of my bank account.

I moved from Octopus to a new supplier (Igloo) on November 15 2020. At the time, Octopus owed me about ¬£190. I had a traditional gas meter and an electric smart meter. The old and new supplier have six weeks to agree what the ‚Äúfinal reads‚Äù are. That is what the readings are on the meters when the changeover occurs. I waited for Octopus to send me the money they owed me.

Once a number of weeks passed, I got in touch with my new supplier. I then found out that there was a disagreement between my old supplier (Octopus) and new supplier about what the ‚Äúfinal reads‚Äù were. To my surprise, it was the electricity reading (where I have a smart meter) that they were in dispute over.  That struck me as odd.

A few weeks later, I received a huge bill from Octopus for about ¬£860 for my electricity. I was very taken aback as you can imagine. I checked what the smart meter told me I used over the last year against the bills I‚Äôd paid. It was as I expected. I couldn‚Äôt understand where this extra ¬£860 came from. Then I realised that the bill was not for my smart meter. It was for a different meter. Octopus had sent me a bill for the wrong meter.

I shared what I‚Äôd found with my new supplier. They identified that the bill was for my old meter, the one I‚Äôd had before the smart meter was installed. So, it was now apparent that Octopus had sent me a bill for a meter that I had not been using. 

When I queried this Octopus, they blamed the new supplier for this wrong meter reading. However, I was already aware that the new supplier had been trying to get Octopus to use my smart meter reading because that got me to send a photo of it to them. Octopus said that, ‚Äúwe just need your new supplier to send over a correct reading for your start date so that we can final bill the account correctly.‚Äù But again, I knew the new supplier had already done this.

I asked Octopus to raise an official complaint (which they‚Äôve never formally acknowledged). And not  to take money from my account for this bill which they agreed was wrong. They took the money from my account on 5 March. Their response to my email complaining about this was:

‚ÄúI have cancelled the direct debit scheduling for you.‚Äù. 

OK, so that‚Äôs a start. Presumably that‚Äôs so they don‚Äôt take more money. But there‚Äôs no apology and no promise to return my money as soon as possible. Indeed,  they totally ignored my request to return my money in a few days.

So, four months on from leaving Octopus, I still do not know when they will pay me what they owe me, and now they have taken more of my money with no apology or timeframe for when they will solve this.

I suspect this will not be resolved until I‚Äôm able to take to the ombudsman.

Octopus Energy have been informed their customer (my mother) has passed away. They asked for death certificate and probate which I sent.

Today I received a message from a debt collection company who are attempting recover funds on behalf of Octopus from my deceased mother. Words fail.

Currently I pay ¬£110 per month direct debit for both gas and electricity and have accrued a credit balance of ¬£660.
According to Octopus, my new monthly payments will now be a little over ¬£350 PER MONTH!
When I spoke to an operative today (15th Feb 2021) I was told that this was correct and that if I had been a new customer then this (¬£350 per month) would be the amount I would be expected to pay.

Following a problem with my electricity meter Octopus insisted that zi must have a SMART meter installed. This was in August last year.

A second SMART mere has been fitted but Octopus cannot connect to it to take any readings. They want me to take my own readings but don‚Äôt provide any details as to how to take my day and night readings.

Almost a scam. The worst customer service.

I wish I could write a positive review for a company providing green energy, however it has been some of the worst service I have ever experienced.

We made the switch to Octopus and had the confirmation email and provided meter readings and paid our first bill. Then we recieved a bill for the same period from our previous supplier. Multiple phone calls to Octopus have sorted nothing and whilst very friendly and polite they don't seem to know what they are doing and have not once let us know what is going on despite multiple requests.

When you call them they have a message saying how great their email support is and to try that. So we did and we have had no reply.

They have taken our money and not provided us with any service, we still show on the national database as being supplied by our old supplier.

Avoid them at all costs and find a different green energy supplier.

I requested a 'Smart meter' from the first day I migrated to Octopus energy and was repeatedly given excuses as to why there was a delay. Some of them acceptable other notes much. I kept getting requests for meter reading. In return I kept telling Octopus that my meter was not showing a reading and chasing up a  'Smart Meter'. I then received a statement from OE saying I was apparently several hundred pounds in credit and would I like either a refund or  have the money credited to my account? I  contacted OE in November to be told  they couldn't verify the amount involved until I had a 'Smart Meter' fitted but not to worry I would have a meter fitted by mid December and any monies due returned  by mid January. It is now the 28th of January and I'm due to have the 'Smart Meter' fitted today. In the meantime I had an e-mail from a lady called Tyra who apologised for the delay but explained that she had been on annual leave. So when someone goes on leave disgruntled and alienated customers are just forgotten? Really. I replied to Tyra's e-mail and as yet one week later have still not received a reply. You shout long and loud about how many customers are impressed with your service, well this might come as a shock but I find your customer care to be shamelessly disrespectful, desultory and despicable. In my case you have shown a cavalier attitude to my issue.  I have no doubt that if I should ever, God forbid, owe you money the attitude from your company would be totally different. Perhaps you could tell me when this matter will be finalised. I'm not expecting a definite day or month but the year it might be dealt with might be nice. I live in the forlorn hope that somebody in your company may stir themselves and sort this out.

2) If you join Octopus Energy, and have a high Direct Debit (whether from start, or suddenly increased) and you try 'calling' them, they have a different line (based on your registered phone number) which they ignore ! They won't pick, in fact, if you keep holding, it's set to auto hang-up. They don't respond to emails either, except, of course if you want to join OE.

I think you can withdraw the ¬£50 too, not just spend it on your energy bill.

With Octopus energy for a year and most of the time they have been fine. However, they emailed me 2 weeks ago to tell me they will be increasing my DD from ¬£60 to ¬£235 a month. My last bill was ¬£23 so rightly I‚Äôve disputed this.
I‚Äôve now contacted them 3x since they auto increased my DD and I‚Äôve heard NOTHING back.
Any company that drops you an email to take an extra ¬£160 a min the front you and then ignore you is not to be trusted. Even with covid and standard response time issues, I‚Äôd still expect a response, even an auto response, within 2 weeks.
They also do not provide a phone number to call as they prefer email so it‚Äôs far easier to be ignored. I now have to cancel and block all payments so that I don‚Äôt get over charged.
They have been a good company until now but clearly they are having some serious CS issues during the current pandemic.

Absolutely fed up with this company if they can call themselves that, horrendous customer service, don't even know when a engineer is going to call, engineers don't visit and give a hours notice to say they Are not coming, started the process on the 14th October to get a meter installed on my new build and still no further forward, been given a date of 18th Feb now but probably won't turn up, tried to sign up to another energy company but can't due to octopus taken on my power line absolutely dreadful company without any engineers in Cornwall.

Did an energy comparison when I moved to a new house and octopus came up with the best deal. However, when I switched I was informed that I could not go in to the tariff that had been advertised due to me having two meters for an old economy 7 system that used to be at the house. The customer service agent said that I could have a new smart meter fitted and have them two old meters decommissioned and that once this was done I could go on to the tariff that had been advertised to me in the comparison site. Three months ago I had the new smart meter fitted but I am still in the old tariff paying much higher bills than were advertised to me. Multiple emails and complaints back and forward has resulted in nothing rectified. They don‚Äôt read the emails properly or understand the problem. One agent even stopped correspondence, just saying it would switch over once the engineer submitted the readings... it‚Äôs been three months! I now can‚Äôt switch to another provider as I have an excessive bill due to not being in the right tariff but whatever I do I can‚Äôt get in to the right one. Terrible experience with this provider. They seem happy to let you pay over the odds once you have switched.

Octopus came to fit a smart meter in December 2019 and somehow my account got transferred to EDF without my consent. It took me 10 months to sort out, ie remain with Octopus.  Tried to change suppliers in September 2020 and Octopus are being unco-operative with my new supplier. No compensation and a lot of my wasted time. Octopus is a very unhelpful company taking no responsibility for their actions.

On leaving asked for refund of over ¬£200 credit.  On receipt of final bill told I owe them money because they hadn't charged me for gas in 2019 to 2020.  This is impossible after my giving monthly readings, paying DD and and having received a separate refund of credit during the same period.  Feels opportunistic and contradicts their own documentation trail.  I will take this to ombudsman because it's a ridiculous grab at final credit balance.  Otherwise I had no issues with the company.

Had solar panels installed in August and are still waiting for a smart meter to be installed so we can claim our export tariff in December. That was 16 weeks ago!  Have tried to contact them to find out when our appointment will be but all we get is the same link to apply for an urgent appointment - Have applied twice and still no appointment.  Really disappointed that we have to keep contacting them to, unsuccessfully, get an answer - but more disappointed that we can't claim our export tariff that we could really use right now.

I switched to this company after reading the glowing reviews, prepared to pay a bit more for a decent customer service. Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed: I applied in early November for a Warm Home Discount and was told that I would hear back by MARCH (my previous supplier processed this in A DAY); then I emailed them a query and, over 48 hours later, I have not had a response yet, when they claim that on that particular day they replied within 6 hours. So not only poor but economical with the truth (at best) too

I am writing this on the first birthday of my SMART meter . This has never worked properly when fitted the gas meter did not transmit so I had no idea as to how much gas had been used due to no-one telling me how the meter worked. It also meant that the display meter did not work Well 10 months later they fixed the gas meter following many many emails BUT not the display meter still waiting for that. I have also emailed Greg Jackson who is the CEO twice now without even the courtesy of a reply. 
He, and I quote from Linked in, Love building organisations around people, disrupting industries which underserve customers and society. Well ? I had to go to the ombudsman to get the first part sorted now I have elected to leave this company. The buck as they say stops here > in this company the example set stops there.

Before you switch to octopus energy, be prepared to pay a lot more than your currently paying. They have no excuse for over charging you. Even after paying them up, six months later they still wanted more money out of nowhere and threatened us with debt collection agency....

Don't use them they are atrocious!!
Don't use them they are atrocious!!! I haven't lived in my property since January 2020 but I owned the property and the bill was in my name. I tried twice to switch the bill to my ex partner in June and they said they had done it they hadn't I was still getting bills and being charged for a property I haven't lived in or used the gas or electric neither has my ex partner he moved out in July. But im still being charged for gas and electricity at 80 pounds per month based on estimated figures. No one has visited my property from them to get meter readings and they refused to go out from June onwards and I now live 132 miles from the property so can not go and get them. Absolutely disgusting company no customer service they read from scrips say they will sort it and never do.... and now its the end of November and still my account is active not closed down even though I called 30th October to cancel and yet again not done save your breath money and sanity dont use them.

I am the landlord of a property and I advised Octopus of the final readings when tenants left and the readings for the new tenants with a 10 day gap which I would have to cover. As I am not resident I gave them my home address , phone number and email address. They sent letters to the property and eventually a tenant advised me . they are certainly not living up to the TV advert.

Tried to sign on with Octopus for a new build property.  They are totally useless.  it has been going on for over 2 months and they cannot even get information on how to get a meter installed in my house.  I am dealing with 3 different people who all claim to be from different departments with separate managers.  Requested calls from each of them, and nothing.  They are hiding behind Covid as an excuse, however the plain truth is that they are totally useless and do not care about customer service.  They have even been billing me each month for gas and electricity that they are not supplying as I don't have meters to connect to.
BEWARE!

I've been with octopus energy for just over 2 years. I've finally decided to switch and pay of my debt.
I am 1 person living in a 1 bedroom flat, with electricity no gas, who's out at work most of the day. So I do not understand how the past 2 years I was nearly ¬£1000 in debt. I mean I must have been paying for the whole street. 
I finally lowing my debt and then got told they are putting my monthly payments up and how much I owe them. Enough is enough. I emailed them, no response as yet. So decided to just pay and leave. 
I do not recommend Octopus, not unless you want to be indebt.

I am finding it impossible to get a refund. My account is in credit for a large sum of money as shown on my account but Customer Services are using excuse after excuse to avoid returning my money.

I have smart meters so they have up to date meter reading available at all times but are insisting that I provide
readings which I am unable to do as I am a pensioner and can't get up a ladder to read the electric meter or remove the cover of the underground gas meter and given that they have the information available electronically why should I have to.?

Any excuse to hang on to MY money.

Don‚Äôt be tempted to switch octopus despite the comparison website making them look like good vale or positive reviews! Many of the glowing reports have a link to the ‚Äòreward for recommending new customers‚Äô bonus. Despite being on a smart meter they do not calculate the amount of electricity you have used for months then dump an unfathomable bill on you which never makes sense. In the past year they have done this twice to me and I really have had enough. Contacting customer services is a waste of time.

Gave me a good quote for a switch so went ahead. Then came an e mail asking for 2 months in advance as according to their credit check company I was a high risk of not paying. Amazing as my credit score is 999 out of 999 with Experian, I also went on their credit check company where there was no such flag ??
I contacted the credit check company for an explanation , still waiting 2 weeks later, so basically between them and their credit check company they are a bunch of liars .

We had a new replacement smart meter installed in April 2020. We have just been informed by Octopus energy we have used ¬£1780 of electricity in 7 months.    This is Six times more than the average users for a similar sized property occording to ofgem.  That was our energy bill for the whole of the previous year.    We both work from home all year and there is no difference in our usage.    It‚Äôs obvious to us that there is a problem with the meter, as this surge in use only occurred once the meter was changed - however Octopus Energy do not agree!!   

Has anyone else had problems with Smart Meters? 

We will be paying nearly ¬£4000 for energy per annum, from being ¬£500 in credit, we are now ¬£1000 in debit !!

This was above what they had estimated but I increased it to cover the higher bills in winter.  When Octopus took over I was ¬£12.?? in debit.  With Octopus I was told I was nearly ¬£400 in debt and they were taking ¬£139,000 a month out of my account.  Needless to say I have changed my provider.  Check your bills regularly or you may be in for a big surprise with a large debit on your account !!!

What a shame. I wanted to switch to an ethical provider when I moved into a new home and came across Octopus. The customer care rep treated me like I was an inconvenience. She told me that 'to switch' I had to call the previous tenants provider and tell them who I was otherwise the 'switch' would be rejected. I was very confused as I had never had to do this moving to a new home before, the new provider usually deals with it. I also informed the rep that I did not know who the new provider was, she just replied' well you need to find out' Just an attitude of 'well that's what you have to do' no help. I rang People's energy immediately after and got a very helpful rep who signed me up and they contact the old tenants provider themselves, which is the norm, hence my confusion at me having to call a provider I had never signed up to in the first place. They also looked up the provider of the previous tenants for me, so this is clearly something Octopus could have done also

Avoid ! Joined Octopus on the proviso they would install a meter on 20th October, got verbal reassurance this would be done once they took over the supply. Job needed to be done on this date as otherwise my tenant would have no electricity. Was told by a manager that tenant could stay in a hotel until meter was installed which because of availability of meter company would mean one month ! 
I am fed up now and asking for them to withdraw my Mpan number so can go to British Gas but they are dragging their heels and wasting more of my time and money

Would not recommend to anyone now due to the problems meter reading are why to high for a 3 bed property. last year's bill was for just over 8000kwh now there saying this year's bill now going to be just over 12000kwh had a in house meter test done which there said it passed. But the tester noted on his paper work that meter reading seem to high for this proptey suggest a check meter fitted if possible. But a octopus energy manger response today was it dont matter what he put on his paper work as that his opinion and we only need to see the results. Glad there calls are recorded.

Here‚Äôs what you need to take into account and let Octopus and Ofgem know. Ofgem need to see this trend in Octopus:

1. If you have come through on Uswitch on a fixed price, they are breaching Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977 if they hike up your price after 1 month.

2. Under General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, they have an obligation to ask how you would like to receive communication from them. Instead the only choice you have is via email. So breach 1. Then they bombard you with marketing: breach 2. 

3. One of their incompetent staff tells you that if you‚Äôre not happy, you can go to Ofgem or the Citizens Advice Bureau. Breach 3: they have an obligation to explain customer‚Äôs rights to them by saying that you have the right to complain and if you have not received a satisfactory solution after 4 weeks, or you have received a deadlock letter, then you have the right to take your case to the Energy Ombudsman and here is their number. But they don‚Äôt. 

4. Please remember that a complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction. They are obliged to treat it as a complaint and investigate it. Again, a breach if they don‚Äôt.

You have rights as a private citizen, a consumer and above all, a retail customer.

Well where to start, I signed up to be able to export electricity to the grid, I started exporting on the 6th of June and they still have not sorted out paying me. The amount of emails that I have sent and my time taken to have to write them with all the evidence has taken me 10s of hours. To date they still haven't sorted it, in fact the policy of ignoring my emails appear to be in place. What they can do? Well set up a Direct Debit appears to the limit of their skills. I have no idea why they have such a high rating, for me I regret leaving EON and I'll be leaving Octopus Energy ASAP.

I was interested in switching to Octopus Energy and tried ringing them to get quote.  After 3 unsuccessful attempts to get through to them by phone, I decided to email them.
I eventually received a reply apologising for the delay.  I had left all my relevant details on the email (apart from my address), such as how much I paid, how large my property is etc.  I even left my telephone number so that they could contact me.
After my second email giving my address, I received a reply telling me the cheapest tariff was ¬£55. Just that!  So I had to email again asking what my day and night rate and standing rate would be.
I received another email advising me of this information and also telling me it would be easier if I phoned them - this was ongoing for two days!
Needless to say, I didn't switch to them.
I thought their customer service was supposed to be excellent but not in this case - it was abysmal!

To cut a very long story short. 

I moved to Octopus earlier this year. Unfortunately I was one of the lucky people who get mixed up with euronious transfers which was not Octopus‚Äôs fault. 

My issue is with helping me get things back to normal as my correct energy supplier. Emails not being replied to. Promised calls that never happen. Incorrect information provided. Complaints closed without the issue being resolved and me notified. 4 months later I‚Äôm back and waiting for the call that all is done only to be told on the regular chaser calls that my case is closed and the issue remains with my billing and connection to my smart meter is not working but thank you for letting them know. ü§Ø

Even emailing the CEO gets no reply.

Avoid this hideous company like the plague !!
Have not been able to make sense of their billing...with pluses and minus's all over the place ...a different amount coming out of my account every month and none of it making any sense...higher bills than I have ever had with any company...and dreadful customer service....wish I had stayed with my old supplier and would advise anyone else to do the same. So much for WHICH magazine promoting a company like this !!

Wow. This company is SO easy to deal with. Always able to get someone on the phone when I don't understand my bill. Responsive over email. I've never won anything, but I love spinning the little prize wheel when I do my monthly meter reading. I'm writing this review because I needed to end my service (I'm moving out of the country) and have spent hours of my life this week on the phone with other utility companies who want to argue and give me the runaround before I can end my contract. I got online and ended my Octopus service with 3 clicks, no hassle. That process epitomizes my entire experience with Octopus - easy, straightforward, and customer-oriented. So instead of spending my time arguing about how I'm really leaving the country, and really need to cancel my service, I'm taking the time I saved and saying a massive THANK YOU to Octopus for being the only utility company I've actually enjoyed interacting with whilst in the UK.

The web site is more like a Bingo firm, but my main gripe is a problem with billing - it is complicated and unnecessarily confusing.  I do not understand why they cannot simply show the meter readings history, the kWh used and the cost.  Why make it more complicated?  Engie got it right for customer service.  Octopus customer service seems like it might be a similar experience to Co-op, which in my case really screwed-up the day/night electricity billing and was never able to correct it. Finally, I would say there are good some good things, so 3 stars.

What a mess! I am an Octopus' customer because they've acquired Engie with whom I had a fixed contract. Octopus sent me a bill for first 3 months (as they are contractually obliged). This was in March. After following 3 months Octopus sent me a bil asking me to pay for the last 6 months! I tried to call them, but after a short time the person I spoked to hang up on me!! I've sent them 2 emails now asking for an urgent contact - Octopus has not provided any response! I don't understand why their reviews were so good - maybe when they had fewer customers the service was better! The worst service I've ever experienced and the issue is still not resolved!!!

joined after iresa collapse. Bills went up but manegeable.
Customer service when issues escalated to managers is poor.  Have contacted my partner multiple times with very dubious consent if any to sell her octopus products when I'm the bill payer . First issue ongoing over a year and now octopus will not discuss. Referred me to ombudsman and then locked my file and will not discuss anything with me (despite being the legal contract holder ) and have admonished themselves of all responsibility for the massive mess created.  One star as bills are accurate.  I cannot recommend any other aspect of this companies operations based on personal experience and how obfuscation seems more important than actually dealing with customers.

I went into a years fixed term contract with octopus back in feb 2019 where I was told that I would only pay ¬£84 A month fixed for one year, I don‚Äôt really use a lot of gas and electric and had a smart meter set up at home to monitor my usage, after the year I was told and sent emails from octopus with the break down, I was in credit to the amount of ¬£198 when I went to get my refund from customer services I was then told that I was no longer in credit and that they had made a mistake and not charged me for my electric from sep 2019 to dec 2019 even though ¬£84 came out my bank via direct debit On each month in question for which I have bank statements as proof, spent a few weeks back and forward with emails to be told a different story from another member of the customer service team, after raising a complaint which didn‚Äôt seem to be taken seriously in my eyes I requested to speak to a manager, that was over a week ago and am still waiting to hear back from them, this is totally unacceptable, will be posting this all over social media so other people don‚Äôt get tricked by this company, even though they admitted making the mistake they are still refusing to pay back the amount I was in credit for and will be taking this further after seeking legal advice. So if your thinking of going with them your better off throwing your money down a drain at least you stand a better chance of getting it back that way then through this company. Absolutely disgusting service as I‚Äôm a single parent with a 3 year old with the length of time this has been going on. i have to give them 1 star so I can write the review otherwise if I could they wouldn‚Äôt even be worth 1 star at all.

I switched to Octopus after completing the online survey submitting exact figures of consumption. My bill has doubled , wait for it, not in a month   in 20 days! They say I have consumed nearly ¬£200 of gas and ¬£200 of electricity in 20 days!! My heating has not been on for almost 8 weeks now . When I rang they said there had been a glitch with the internet reading the smart meter. As my account showed I was almost ¬£200 in credit I emailed them and asked for a refund. I was told no as they had not had sufficient readings between Feb 8th and May 16th. When I went back online to check my account the balance in credit info seems to have vanished ü§î

i have been paying way over the odds for my energy since Octopus took over from Coop in 2019.  The billing system is extremely confusing and when I complain and ask someone to look into why I appear to be paying more than anticipated I get a further quote for a cheaper tariff rather than any form of explanation.  My bills have averaged ¬£93 per month over a 9 month period despite living on my own and being extremely careful about not wasting or overusing fuel (as advised). I am now looking for a better supplier with a simplified billing system.  I am extremely disappointed with Octopus Energy and would not recommend them to anyone.  The Co-op was much cheaper and more straightforward.

I had an absolutely terrible time with Octopus Energy. They are not the professional corporate company as they might appear to be. They hugely underestimated my direct debits and the bills didn't cover both gas and electricity, even though I submitted both meter readings at the same time. The dashboard didn't show clearly how much I owed. By the time I realised what was happening, I was in very high surprise debt. I contacted customer service to complain and the advisor just carried on like nothing was wrong. My complaint wasn't escalated. I highly recommend that you avoid this company at all costs.

Having now been with octopus energy for a year I cannot recommend them high enough. Their estimate and price for my usage/cost was spot on (unlike other suppliers who's estimate was low and bumped up my monthly charge soon after joining). My account visibility is clear (again unlike others I've used which seem to try and confuse), and i can get a refund frommy octopus account without having to jump through hoops if I find that my usage for a period is low.

On top of that I get a chance to win credit to my account every month and can leavevsithout penalties whenever I want, but that I would.

One of the best, and cheapest energy suppliers I've come across.

Also if you use the link below as a recommendation, you get ¬£50 credit to your account when you switch....can't be bad. Just use the following removing the spaces https:// share.octopus.energy / azure-dog-74 or go to their website and use azure-dog-74 as the recommendation code

Terrible company. How which rated these as good i have no idea. Constantly lied to. They are forever trying to get you off the phone. Email response i sent 20 plus emails got 1 response in 3 weeks. If you phone they cancel any emails sent as they think its been answered. Phoned loads got through 3 times. They conveniently dont record the important phone calls. I was forced to move from engie as they left uk i dont blame them shame as it was awesome company. Left engie phoned them 4 days before switch they said all bills paid was ¬£284 in credit. Went to engie kept paying bills they took 2 payments and by feb was over ¬£400 in credit after they re calculated my usage and money from engie. Spoke to octopus staff they said paid up till feb. Then in march all went wrong went from ¬£400 credit to ¬£80 credit overnight!!!! So phoned them spoke to a manager not an easy thing to do at this company. She said all paid up i gave meter readings she said i was over ¬£80 in credit still. Next thing 4 days later im just ¬£20 in credit. So i phoned again and they denied i was ever ¬£80in credit and that i owed money from september to now hense why i lost the ¬£400 but ive only been with octopus energy since mid feb so how can i owe them money from months before i joined up. They say its quarterly billing but like i said i was straight with engie before i left. And even so quartly billing is only sep to end december not march so id still be in credit!! I phoned and emailed they were supposed to get back to me on over 20 occasions not once got back to me. Except with 5 automated emails 1 response as i said but it was useless didnt answer any of my questions and once from this manager who again just spouted policy and didnt actually answer a question!!! I asked for them to look into it and compensation for all the hasstle and again no response. This company has zero customer service not polite on phone they keep saying is that it. Or right thanks and trying to get you off. This company needs investigating and there email system is usless. Dont feel like a valued customer at all. Im trying to leave but it takes 17 days and guess what now they say my credit is just ¬£20 and im paid till april!! So how does ¬£20 cover a month when i somehow according to them spent ¬£60 in 4 days. They have always had meter readings.

It's hysterical they say ""They've answered calls within 2 minutes on average over the last year"" ü§£ü§£ü§£ ! You can never get to speak to anyone when you call and they don't respond to emails.. Octopus Energy - seriously. Sort it out, you're a joke üëéüëéüëéüò°üò°üò°

DO NOT USE OCTOPUS IF YOU NEED A NEW CONNECTION.  I asked for a new connection in December 2019.  11 weeks later and I still do not have a connection.  Lots of emials, lots of calls.  No action.  They did manage to switch my supplier , but I had not asked them to switch my exisitng supplier! I had to arrange getting it switched back and the accounts settled between the two companies.  
3 months later and I am still needing a new conenction for a new building.  They have taken ¬£220 from me on direct debit, so far,  for a supply that is not even connected to the grid yet.

Switched to British Gas on 5th February.   Octopus took further direct debit on the 15th February.   Bit if a surprise as I they already owed me over ¬£300 in overpayment.  Now it's over ¬£400.  Tried emailing - no replies.  Tried phoning - eventually got through only to be told they were waiting to agree electricity charge with BG.  Contacted BG.  No all done.  They are fine while you are a customer, but when they gave your money and are no longer a customer seems to be a bit tricky getting it back.

I transferred suppliers based solely on the numbers and backed up by the reviews. Fundamentally it's all about what your numbers are per year and balancing that against other suppliers with lower costs including standing charge.
Based on the info supplied initially by USwitch and then Octopus I would save about ¬£10 per month .
The first month I started off at the new rate of ¬£55 per month. After two months Octopus emailed me to say from my next payment (2 days later) it would be ¬£100 per month!!!!
They really dont like you calling them and prefer you to email. After 2 days of no response I sat through the automated hell of being told, ""We normally answer calls within a minute"" followed by a Customer Service manager recording saying, ""Sorry about this, but please feel free to email"". 
I eventually got through to a rep after 27 mins and the debate started . They informed me that as i was going into the winter months it was advisable to build a pool of funds to cover the larger bills. I was also informed that they needed to establish data relating to my usage. I advised the rep that I had the last two years data and as a widower in a energy efficient new home there had be little change showing that the  amounts I had being paying were stable.
I agreed at a ¬£85 payment but emphasised that as a retired CFO I knew the numbers and this was all about them having my money not about usage. Additionally I reiterated that the last two providers I had would let you run at a monthly loss knowing the summer months would see the gain.
Well fast forward a year and 12 months data was available along with a sizable pot to prove at the point of renewing that i could drop my monthly amount. I renewed for a year based on a monthly debit of ¬£68 (still ¬£13 more than initially specified by their contract) 
A month ago my yearly contract was up and looking at the numbers and defaqto ratings I decided to change providers. I received the normal email asking not to leave and contact them for a better price. After 42mins on hold a rep informed me within a minute that they would not price match or better my numbers and said goodbye.
So ..... in the last day of transfer I supplied both Octopus and my new supplier with the numbers and  that day received a final bill from OE. At that point I emailed asking when my ¬£142 would be refunded back to me and waited 3 working days without a response. I tried calling customer services and realised that they only operate Mon-Fri. On the Monday morning I spent 46 mins on hold listening to the customer service manager asking me to email and that they answer calls within a minute!!!!
The rep eventually spoke to advised me that until they can prove the numbers with the new supplier then the refund would not be issued. I pointed out that the bill had been drafted and paid and the amount to be refunded would not change. I was eventually told I could have a partial refund and that they would endeavour to have it to me within 3 working days. When I enquired about the remaining amount I was told it could take a couple of weeks!!!
This is the first review relating to a provider I have supplied in many years that is negative.  I go out of my way to capture positive info and supply it to help others .
My experience of Octopus Energy is as supplied. 
My view, unprofessional, unresponsive and not worth signing up to!!

Terrible company, they constantly spout about their wonderful email system, but have totally ignored three consecutive emails and I have had to phone them. They also state that when Co-op energy basically sold our accounts to Octopus that our prices would stay the same or possibly cheaper, we were also told that we are still Co-op customers. All total lies. My charges have gone up. They put me on a normal tariff when I should be on economy seven, my gas prices have gone up, with no notification that they were doing so. As for being a Co-op energy customer, just try contacting co-op energy, all attempts lead straight to octopus. The Co-op have simply handed their customers over to an incompetent and disreputable company.

Was switched to Octopus as they took over Co-OP in July. I had no statement at all for 4 months despite me ringing up. Then I was suddenly in debit of ¬£185 despite never having any problems with coop. Then in January they put my account ¬£400 in credit and said they were reviewing it and this week I'm ¬£300 in debit! Formal complaint going in

These excellent reviews must be fake 
We have had a simply awful experience with octopus Energy 
The customer service is appalling with weeks between replies and no way to escalate issues 
We have had to have our meters changed which took an age even though one of them wasn‚Äôt working ( they said it was) and then they ripped us off and felt we should be grateful full. Had to chase the joining insensitive and currently do not have a working display probably so we cannot see how they are continuing to rip us off!! They have taken two payments in January with no explanation- would not recommend at all!!!

I was switched to Octopus energy by cooperative without any discussion or agreement.  I have a key meter for my electric and my key stopped working yesterday so I cannot top up or activate the emergencybalance.  I reported via email as advised because their office was closed, they ignored it. I have been on the phone to them since midday and they refused to accept my emergency situation until my electric goes off. Its winter, extremely cold and I have an autistic child, we're all sat here by candlelight shivering. When they finally accepted my ""emergency "" they have given me an appointment for 7.30pm making us wait with no power over 3 hours. Shocking customer service and no consideration for vulnerable families.  I would never choose this company and will force them to let me leave whilst reporting them to OFGEM

i was cold called, via a telephone call center. i was told, by the call center, that Octopus would 99% guarantee to beat what i was currently paying. Not only could Octopus NOT beat what i was currently paying with BRITISH GAS. Octopus could not even give me a quote on supplying GAS ONLY, as my electricity is on a key meter. in short total waste of time dealing with this company.

I changed over to Octopus just over a  months ago, transferring easily and smoothly and it is the best thing I have done.  I can't believe how good they are, their customer service is exceptional, via email, I no longer have to hang on the phone for hours ending up stressed and frustrated.  Their administration via email is absolutely spot on.  I gave my meter readings yesterday afternoon and straight away I had my bill - it was laid out simply and easy to understand, showing my readings, how much Gas and Electricity I had used etc.  I am really happy with the price.  Have not had any reason to contact them as all so far has been fine.

We switched to Octopus over a year ago. We have been pleased with the service and have had no problems. Our electric bill have been cheaper and we gained ¬£50 when we switched. We have regular emails and have to add metre readings when they are due. It is all quite clear and straightforward. I like also they they use 100% renewable electricity.

Very rude staff, absolutely disgusting customer service. Tried to charge us for a month before we moved in (property was empty for six months). They said we were still with them until the 19th of October and have continued to try to charge us up to the 1st of November even though they themselves confirmed our energy supplier spark energy had taken over on the 19th of October. Everytime I tried to talk the member of staff Charlie he spoke over me even after I asked him not to do so.

Do not go with octopus energy their rude, money grabbing fraudsters. Most definitely DO NOT recommend unless you like to be spoken to as less than human.

I have recently joined Octopus and so far I am very disappointed.  Having moved into a new house which has a dangerous 3 phase meter in an open wooden box in our garden we have been told this needs changed urgently.  More concerning I have young children playing in the garden.  Octopus have been very unhelpful at correcting this and so far we are waiting 5 weeks for their engineer.  What is now concerning is they will not give a set time which is useless as the engineer needs to be on site the same time as our electrician and the DNO.  I am currently looking at changing from Octopus due to this poor service and huge health and safety issue which is not being resolved.

Lots of promise but no delivery!
I changed to Octopus on 3/9/19 with the intention of joining their ""Go"" tariff. Despite having a smart meter installed in November I was told it wasn't suitable and I needed a new one. I was told I would be contacted within 14 days and in the meantime I would be on their flexible tariff. 14 days came and went and eventually I contacted them and was given a date of 21/10/19 for the new meter. The meter was duly fitted but would not connect to the Octopus system so it was still ""dumb"". I waited a further week for another engineer. Same problem but this time he eventually changed the comms unit on the meter and got it working! At last - I thought. On 7/11/19 I contacted them again - by phone cause emails about meters get no reply - to be told it would be another week before they could connect me to their Go tariff. I am not optimistic. The timescales they quote are 14 days for a meter and 7 days to establish readings are coming through - in my case it is now more than two months. It should have been done by 24/9/19.
I have a Tesla battery so I want Go in the winter so as I store night electricity and release it during the day. At present I am effectively paying three times the cost of the Go tariff for my electricity and I would have been much better off getting an economy 7 meter from Scottish Power. They have given me a ¬£20 rebate but I am getting very frustrated at the lack of progress despite their promises. The thing is that I will be self sufficient by March and, since Octopus standing charge is 25p per day, I will be changing back to Scottish Power who are 11.5p per day. I have suggested to Octopus that they should develop a seasonal tariff but I got no response so it looks like I will be chopping and changing every few months so I will be faced with all this hassle again and again!

I‚Äôm totally disappointed and saddened by how I‚Äôve been treated by Octopus. My old provider (Iresa) went into administration 18 months ago and they took over my acct. I had about ¬£400 in debit with them and, rather than billing that from me in a measured amount, Octopus put me on a ‚Äòflexible‚Äô rate tariff and charged me almost nothing each month until my debt increased to ¬£1000 in debit. Then, for the past 8 months they hit my account with debits of ¬£180 per month. I only became aware of this last week and was mortified. I immediately cancelled my contract with them and switched to British Gas who will be charging me a fixed rate of ¬£80. Octopus then informed me I still owe ¬£400.
I don‚Äôt know how they feel that charging customers in such an erratic way is acceptable. I‚Äôm a single mother and genuinely don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll pay my mortgage this month because of this. They have taken over ¬£2000 off me in 18 months and now want a further ¬£400. It‚Äôs despicable and I intend to spread the word that this company is both irresponsible and ruthless.

Do not believe the fake and paid for positive reviews on here. They are produced to hide the bad reviews that genuine customers are leaving, so here's another genuine review from me which will be submitted repeatedly until someone sorts my problem out. 

On 31st July, I submitted electricity meter readings, not noticing how high the difference was in comparison to the previous month. It transpires (after receiving my bill) that I had used 3 times as much electricity as my previous month's. My electricity bills went from ¬£25-¬£30 per month to over ¬£100.00!!! How is this even possible when nothing has changed, if anything I have reduced due to working more hours out of my home. 

I immediately called Octopus Energy about my issue, they told me to carry out a test to isolate all power and see if my meter increases on its own. Well, it did, 3kwh over the space of 2 hours. This would equate to around ¬£7.00 per day with no power being drawn through the meter. Evidence was sent through and they booked an engineer in to have a look. Well, a month later when the engineer was supposed to turn up, a day before they were scheduled, Octopus Energy said ""the engineer was unable to stick with your appointment so can we book it in for another few weeks?"" How is it possible that the engineer you booked in, manage to unbook themselves from an appointment. It is Octopus Energy's responsibility to manage this appointment successfully. So, engineer arrives, doesn't know what he's doing properly, has to resort to calling someone else and asking then what to do, goes away, I hear nothing from Octopus Energy. I had to chase them to find out what the outcome was. They said my meter was working fine based on the report from the engineer!! I'm sorry but judging by the incompetencies of the engineer, I very much doubt that 'his' findings were accurate, especially when it is clear that my meter reading is increasing at a significant rate with no power being on. 

So...another engineer is booked in by Octopus Energy. Their 3rd party engineer company call me and I ask them will this test be the same as last time, they said 'yes it will'. I ask them, 'why on earth would you carry out the same test as last time?'  Their response was that Octopus Energy instructed them to do this test. Engineer comes out 2 weeks later, does the same test and guess what? Nearly 2 weeks later I STILL have not received any response from Octopus Energy on this 'test' but I have received an email from them about them wanting to increase my direct debit to ensure that I'm up to date regarding payments for my increase of energy!!!!! 

Are you having a giraffe??? My bills are high becasue there is a problem with my meter that YOU are supposed to be fixing Octopus Energy!!!!

This has been taken to the Energy Ombudsman as an official complaint. 

So be warned, never believe everything you see on here. Do yourself a favour consumers, filter at the top 'bad' reviews to see the real Octopus Energy

Octopus energy told several lies in their sales pitch. They insisted they could save us money yet within a 2 months of being with them they upped the payments to what I was previously paying, so no saving made. We were also told our smart meter would work but then later told it would need to be changed. I paid ¬£60 to leave previous supplier early because it seemed like a good deal, but it was anything but and have ended up out of pocket. I rarely leave a negative review but I have had such a negative experience it is necessary.

Absolutely horrid company that you should avoid at all costs. We moved into a house with this provider, they sent us an estimated bill a month later that was about 10 times the actual realistic useage. 
Kept bombarding us with letters to 'set-up the account', where the instructions don't work and links to their website are broken: there's no way to actually set up an account on their useless website to submit meter readings if the property is already supplied by this provider (and I now what I'm talking about as a software engineer).
Not surprisingly it's full of 5 star reviews here from people who are just posting their referral links. Complete scam.

        reading - with a chance to win up to ¬£500.

4)     NO Exit Fees
5)     LOW tariffs
6)     Special tariffs for owners of Electric Vehicles, Solar Batteries and 
         Storage Heaters - look for they're 'Agile Octopus' and 'Octopus

Always good when you finally talk to them on the 'phone, shame that their automated systems and engineers are less reliable. 

I have previously emailed their Hello@... email address four times. Not once have I received a response, however when I follow up with a phone call days later, they acknowledge receipt of the email but give no explanation why it wasn't acted on. One of these occasions was to transfer the account of a deceased relative!

I‚Äôve been with octopus energy for six months. I find the customer service excellent. I was with British Gas and the running costs of are now cheaper. I love the quirky approach they take to customer service. The website is intuitive and easy to use. I religiously now submit my meter reading. At the moment there‚Äôs a chance for existing customers to win a car. They don‚Äôt seem to ignore this already signed with them. You can get ¬£50 when you switch and enter the car prize draw here ww.octopusreferral.link Highly recommended.

Excellent Utility company, cheaper energy bills, only 3 tariffs to choose from and no exit fees if you decide to leave. Trusted and recommended by MSE Martin Lewis. Easy to use app for meter readings. They have a good deal on a 12 month fixed tariff that could save you money compared to your current supplier.
Added bonus to any new customers considering signing up. Please feel free to take advantage of my friends and family referral link and we both get a free ¬£50 account credit, thank you

Swapped to Octopus Energy in September Brilliant!!!!
Swapped to Octopus Energy in September, and it's probably one of the easiest switches and best decision I've ever done.
The customer service is exceptional and the pricing is very competitive. The added bonus of the ¬£50.00 credit was a great little sweetener and gets paid within days of the first Direct Debit payment going out, this can be refunded back into your bank if you request it, and again the communication has been brilliant. The app is really easy to use, submitting meter reads is simple enough, and the fact they understand you may build a bit of a debit through the winter months as it evens out during the summer months meaning no unexpected Direct Debit increases (which I had with Southern Electric!)
Honestly can't fault them, and if you use the link below you'll also get ¬£50.00 credit added to your account when you sign up,
